https://huntnewsnu.com/58316/featured-content/frisky-husky-delivers-free-contraception-to-students/,Frisky Husky delivers free contraception,"Yunkyo Kim, news staff","March 4, 2019","The Office of Prevention and Education, or OPEN, piloted the Frisky Husky program last semester to deliver free sexual health supplies with guaranteed confidentiality to Northeastern University students who live in on-campus housing. 
In its second semester of operation, Frisky Husky remains a pilot program, but administrators say they received positive responses from its users so far. 
“We’re really excited to share that all students who have placed orders have supplies and we were able to meet all of their requests from the students who ordered from the pilot program,” said Stephanie Ellman, the program administrator at OPEN who helped create the program, which was modeled after a similar initiative at Boston University. 
Students in need of sexual health products can order through the OPEN website to gain access to contraceptives such as condoms, oral dams and water-based lubricants. Through the delivery service, OPEN also aims to provide education on sexually transmitted infection testing and affirmative consent.
Ally Lowits, president of NU Sexual Health Advocacy, Resources and Education, or NU SHARE, said that the program was beneficial, but that it should be extended beyond on-campus housing.
“As a human being, I think access to safe sex is super important and it’s great that Northeastern is providing it at people’s doorsteps,” said Lowitz, a second-year psychology major. “Unfortunately, it’s only for students living on-campus; I believe they’re trying to work on that though.” 
The OPEN office plans to gather official feedback from Frisky Husky’s users and consider expanding the program to serve larger geographic regions of the NU student body.  
“We’ll continue to look at demands to see where we’re really doing well, where there might be some opportunities to get the education or the supplies to the hands of more students,” Ellman said.  
SGA President Dylan Balcom said in a February interview with The News that he hopes to work toward adding a similar service that delivers menstrual products to students."
https://huntnewsnu.com/58293/campus/obituaries/michaela-mclaughlin-remembered-as-strong-compassionate/,"Michaela McLaughlin remembered as strong, compassionate","Rachel Morford, news correspondent","March 4, 2019","Michaela McLaughlin – a Northeastern student who is remembered for her strength, wisdom and enduring friendships – died of cancer surrounded by family on Feb. 12 at Massachusetts General Hospital. She was 22 years old. 
“When you were with Michaela, everything was simply better. Her smile made you smile, her laugh made you laugh. The dedication she had toward her friends and loved ones was incomparable,” said second-year nursing major and McLaughlin’s sorority “grand little” Maeve McCuine in a Feb. 28 email to The News.
Born Sept. 30, 1996, McLaughlin grew up in the town of Hollis in southern New Hampshire. She attended Hollis Brookline High School, where she was a member of the National Honor Society, the Ski Team and the Math Team, according to a Feb. 14 obituary published in the Nashua Telegraph. McLaughlin had a deep bond with her hometown, maintaining close relationships with many of her oldest friends after graduating from high school in 2015, said McLaughlin’s mother, Iris McLaughlin, in a eulogy she wrote for her daughter. 
“Especially as she came home from college, and brought friends along, she realized how much she liked recognizing so many familiar faces, appreciated the farms and beauty of our town, and how she felt a sense of community and belonging,” Iris McLaughlin wrote.
In fall of 2015, McLaughlin began her first semester at Northeastern University studying abroad in Australia through the N.U.in program. Here, McLaughlin met many of her closest friends, including her boyfriend Julian Fricks.
“Neither of us really knew when we started dating, which is interesting,” said Fricks, a fourth-year bioengineering major. “We had to debate over what to choose as our anniversary date. It was all pretty effortless.”
McLaughlin pursued a degree in industrial engineering, with minors in mathematics and business administration. She originally planned to graduate in 2020, although after taking medical leave, this date was moved to 2021, said Brian Hempe, a fourth-year mechanical engineering student and one of McLaughlin’s friends. Despite the change in her graduating class, McLaughlin’s original classmates thought of her often and fondly. 
“There was always a thought in our heads that Michaela would be back in class for Capstone and we’d re-do our second year together,” said fellow industrial engineering major and fourth-year Trevor Fick in a Feb. 28 email to The News. 
According to a Feb. 19 email sent to members of the College of Engineering by Dean Nadine Aubry, McLaughlin was involved in many NU campus organizations – including N.U.in Campus Connections and intramural broomball. McLaughlin also served as volunteer chair of the Society of Women Engineers, or SWE, and sisterhood chairwoman of the her sorority, Delta Zeta. She was particularly passionate about her involvement in SWE, said McLaughlin’s older sister Kara McLaughlin. 
“It was such a wonderful group for her,” Kara McLaughlin said. “I think to have a group of women who were all doing the same thing in kind of a man-dominated field – that was something that she was really proud of.” 
Perhaps more than anything, McLaughlin’s friends and family will forever remember the incredible relationships she maintained with so many individuals. McLaughlin had friends from her hometown, from N.U.in, from her sorority and from classes. Despite these many connections, the strength of her relationship with those she cared about never varied from one individual to the next, said fourth-year business administration major Tara Boyle. 
“She never categorized [her friends] or made someone feel more special than another,” said Boyle, who was also McLaughlin’s roommate and sorority sister. “She just didn’t think that way. You know, some people think like, ‘Oh, that’s my best friend or whatever, so I treat them like this.’ Michaela actually treated everyone with the same level of respect.”
Hempe had a similar sentiment, emphasizing McLaughlin’s commitment to the bonds she formed with others.
“She really took a personal interest in whoever she was meeting with and whoever she was trying to stay in contact with,” he said. “It wasn’t just surface level connections she ever made with someone, she always went out of her way to make it deep and personal.”
McLaughlin always remembered her friend’s important dates — be it birthdays, interviews or exams mentioned weeks previously, said McLaughlin’s friend and sorority sister Nicole Muir. Muir experienced this recently when she interviewed for her top-choice graduate program. After the interview, Muir checked her phone and saw that McLaughlin had sent her a venmo payment with the instructions, “Get yourself a giant coffee.” 
“Not only was she there to listen and be excited with me, but she also knew just what I would want as soon as I was finished,” Muir said in a Feb. 28 email to The News. “She was my cheerleader in so many ways and could anticipate my needs even before I could.” 
This thoughtfulness and sincere interest did not waver during McLaughlin’s illness, said Boyle. 
“She didn’t let it change her spirit. Even though her body was fighting, it didn’t make her a combative person at all,” Boyle said.
Her friends and family were continually awed by her ability to remain positive and her selfless nature. 
“She was always willing to bend over backwards for others. I think that all of her friends would say she was always there for them,” Kara McLaughlin said. “There were times where she would be so sick, and she was still willing to listen to everybody else’s stories and try to help them. She was just so resilient and she taught us so, so much.”
One time, after McLaughlin received a procedure at the hospital, Fricks witnessed the extent of how much she cared for others.
“She was in some sort of a stupor, and she asked me to make sure that anyone else that needed the procedure had gotten it too,” Fricks said. “She always wanted to make sure everybody else was taken care of first.”
McLaughlin accepted offers at two different co-ops during her time at Northeastern. The first was a position for fall of 2016 at General Electric, or GE, Aviation. McLaughlin was never able to start, Fick and Hempe said.
“I was supposed to work with her at GE Aviation, and she got sick right when she took that job. So she wasn’t able to actually,” Hempe said. “I was always pretty upset about that.”
After being declared cancer-free in September of 2017, McLaughlin returned to school for classes in spring 2018, and accepted a second co-op at TJX Industries for fall 2018, Fick said. McLaughlin worked about a month before the resurgence of her cancer. Kara McLaughlin said her sister greatly enjoyed the experience. The position at TJX was ideal for someone with her talent and interests, Fricks said. 
“She loves fashion and she loves planning things,” he said. “And that sector of industrial engineering could sort of combine those two passions for her.” 
In addition to her many friendships and extracurriculars, McLaughlin enjoyed boating, skiing and completing complicated Lego sets, including models of the Sydney Opera House and the Eiffel Tower, Fricks said. McLaughlin also enjoyed apple picking and watching the leaves change in the autumn, said friend and roommate Laura Jones, a fourth-year business administration major, in a Feb. 27 email to The News. McLaughlin often involved others in these activities, frequently extending invitations to her home in Hollis, said Jones and Hempe.
“Michaela was very family oriented and she always jumped at an opportunity to bring her Northeastern friends home to Hollis for a home-cooked meal,” Jones said. “Michaela always strived to make sure everyone was taken care of, and this showed in her openness to welcome any and all of us into her home and her family whenever we needed it.”
McLaughlin was also a fan of country music, especially of artists Kenny Chesney and Lady Antebellum, Kara McLaughlin said. This musical preference was a source of humor for Fricks and McLaughlin.
“There is this one song that had the line ‘sweeter than a sugar cane,’ which I thought was just really cliché and kind of stupid. We had a long ongoing joke about that song,” he said. “I still don’t really like country music, but I guess I’ll always have a soft spot for it now.”
McLaughlin was a diehard fan of the New England Patriots, and especially of quarterback Tom Brady. Supporting the Patriots was a shared family passion, Kara McLaughlin said. Before this year, McLaughlin had never missed a playoff game. In October, the McLaughlin family joined hundreds of other cancer survivors and caretakers on the field in Gillette Stadium as part of the NFL’s “Crucial Catch” initiative, which raises money and awareness for cancer, according to the NFL’s website. After the demonstration, the McLaughlins stayed to watch the Patriots play. Kara McLaughlin appreciated sharing this moment with her sister.
“You got to be part of the pre-game thing on the field. And she got to bring us as guests. So we got a big flag out on the field before the game started. And they had a luncheon,” Kara McLaughlin said. “So, that was the last game that we went to together. And it was really special.” 
In addition to her kindness and friendship, McLaughlin is remembered for her sharp sense of humor and wisdom. 
“She had a concept of what actually mattered,” Boyle said. “Just this kind of understanding of actually matters, and what you should and shouldn’t be stressing out about.”
At the close of her eulogy, Iris McLaughlin spoke to her daughter directly:
“As we told you Michaela — you are simply the light leading the way and we will be following you one day. We love you always and forever.” 
In addition to her sister and mother, McLaughlin is survived by her father and namesake, Michael McLaughlin, as well as numerous relatives and friends. Her family requests that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Tucker Gosnell Center and Caring for a Cure at Massachusetts General Hospital.

The loss dropped them down to 13th in the Pairwise rankings, worsening their position for the NCAA tournament. With only two games left in the conference season, Northeastern could finish anywhere from second to seventh in the final standings. To make matters worse, they had to play against the same BC team that beat them, this time without arguably their best skater.
The Jeremy Davies-less Huskies (22-10-1, 14-8-1 HEA) faced the Eagles (11-19-3, 10-10-3 HEA) at Matthews Arena in an attempt to avenge their 3-1 loss the prior night. Davies received a one-game suspension from Hockey East after a game misconduct penalty at 19:28 of the third period of Friday’s game.
Davies has amassed 32 points this season, leading the team, and was nominated for the Hobey Baker Award in January. Davies was also  in good form recently, winning the Hockey East Player of the Month award for February after scoring 12 points on three goals and nine assists. In his stead, other players would need to step up if the Huskies were to win Saturday. And they did, beating BC 4-2.
Freshman defenseman AJ Villella was the first to step up, pulling out a moment of magic to give the Huskies the 1-0 lead with less than four minutes off the clock. Ryan Shea played a pass to Villella at the point, and he slapped the puck top-shelf, giving BC goalkeeper Joe Woll no time to react.
“We dressed seven defensemen out here tonight, and four of them got a lot of ice time: [Julian] Kislin, [Eric] Williams, Shea and [Jordan] Harris obviously logged a lot of minutes, they were all probably 23-24 plus,” head coach Jim Madigan said of his short-staffed defense. “I thought AJ Villella did a good job. Carrabino and Murphy were used sparingly but did a good job when they went out there. They all stepped up.”
Seconds later, Zach Solow almost had a second, flicking a backhand towards the same corner Villella hit, only to be denied by the pipe.
The Huskies hit a second pipe later in the period when Matt Filipe broke through on goal after stealing the puck from a BC defender. Filipe lined up a wrister, but hit the outside of the pipe, barely missing his eighth goal of the year.
Late in the period, BC had a goal taken away as forward David Cotton had the puck in the back of the net, but the whistle had blown before the puck bounced out of NU goalkeeper Cayden Primeau’s mitt toward Cotton.
The first period ended with a strong spell of BC pressure, resulting in 15 saves by Primeau. Despite the shot margin (BC outshooting NU 15-8), NU held the lead going into the locker room.
The Huskies absorbed the BC pressure and lashed out when given a power-play opportunity. They generated two huge chances with the extra man through freshman forward Tyler Madden, who ripped a shot at Woll before getting it back off the rebound and seeing his effort cleared away by a BC defender.
Primeau pulled off one of the saves of the season with 0.2 seconds left in the second period, flying back across his goal to glove a Julius Mattila rocket that was bound for the top corner.
Fresh out of the penalty box with just over a minute off the clock in the third, senior forward Patrick Schule gave Northeastern a 2-0 lead. After sitting for the start of the period following a late-second-period penalty, Schule raced out of the box looking to make an impact. He took a pass from Harris and, after seeing his first shot blocked, ripped the rebound off the pipe and in for his 10th goal of the year.
Just minutes later the Huskies got their third after beautiful passing gave senior forward Brandon Hawkins an opening to score his ninth of the season. John Picking played a centering pass to Harris, who unselfishly made the extra pass to set up Hawkins in front of the net. He rifled his shot past Woll at the left post to give the Huskies a 3-0 lead.
“For defensemen, the faster they can move it up to our forwards then join the rush, I think that’s the most important thing. So i thought he did a better job here today just moving pucks and then joining the rush. He made a real good play there on that goal, it was a big goal for us, and he defended well in his own zone,” Madigan said of Harris.
The Huskies pressed on, looking to better their rivals’ goal tally from the prior night, a feat which they accomplished when senior forward Austin Plevy scored the fourth goal. Picking once again played a dangerous pass across the face of goal, and Plevy got just enough contact on it to redirect it past Woll and in off the post.
BC would grab a goal back with just over three minutes remaining with David Cotton scoring his 20th of the season. Cotton found a rebound in front of the net and slid his shot past Primeau into the bottom left corner of the goal.
Pressing with an extra attacker after pulling Woll, the Eagles got their second goal through Aapeli Rasanen, who scored his fifth goal of the season off another rebound in front. Despite continuing to press, the game would end 4-2 NU.
“Towards the end when you’re nursing a four goal lead at that point, they were coming and they were pressing and they had a few more shots, but I liked our third period,” Madigan said. “Certainly there’s things we’ve got to get a little bit better at, managing pucks a little bit better, being a little more poised with it, but it was a good team win.”
Primeau stopped 41 of the 43 shots he faced, only conceding the two goals off rebounds.
“I thought Cayden Primeau was just immense there, kid gave us a chance to win the game,” Madigan said. “First two periods he was really good.”
The Huskies return to Matthews for their final regular season game Friday against New Hampshire (12-12-9, 8-9-6 HEA). Both teams will be playing for playoff positioning, having already clinched a spot in the tournament."
https://huntnewsnu.com/58280/sports/frankel-shuts-out-vermont-to-send-the-huskies-to-the-hockey-east-semifinals/,Frankel shuts out Vermont to send the Huskies to the Hockey East semifinals,"Mike Puzzanghera, sports editor","March 2, 2019","Northeastern followed up their seven-goal outing Friday with a defensive battle Saturday, only needing one goal as Aerin Frankel shut out Vermont 1-0 to send Northeastern through to the next round of the Hockey East playoffs.
NU (25-5-5, 21-3-3 WHEA) took on Vermont (10-20-6, 8-15-4 WHEA) at Matthews Arena for the second game of their best-of-three playoffs series. After winning Friday’s game 7-2, the Huskies needed one more win to move on, while Vermont’s season would end with a loss.
The Huskies broke the opening deadlock at 10:12 with senior forward Kasidy Anderson scoring for her 100th career point. Playing for a minute and a half with an extra attacker during a delayed Vermont penalty, the Huskies took full advantage, with Anderson redirecting a shot from junior defender Codie Cross, flicking it past Vermont goaltender Blanka Skodova.
“I think it was a crucial time to score because obviously the penalty is still called even if we score with the man up,” Anderson said. “Codie had the one-timer last night, and so I saw the puck going to her and I knew I just had to get in front of the net and she was going to take a quick shot and just try to get my stick on it because we knew that there was one way to beat [Skodova].”
Northeastern’s defensive dominance in the first period shows most clearly in the shot margins: UVM only managed three shots on goal, all saved by Frankel, while NU had 11.
The second period was a different story. While neither team managed a goal, it was much more of a back-and-forth affair. The Huskies managed 17 shots compared to Vermont’s seven, but Vermont still threatened with the chances they had, with Frankel forced to make some important stops.
Skodova’s 27 saves at the end of two kept Vermont in the game. She denied every shot in the period, including huge chances from Cross, Skylar Fontaine and Micaela Sindoris. But perhaps the Huskies’ biggest chance came when a low cross from Alina Mueller just evaded the stick of Tori Sullivan with Skodova scrambling to get in position.
The third period was dominated by Vermont as they outshot Northeastern 12 to four. They continued to push forward with their season on the line. However, Northeastern dealt with the onslaught effectively.
“I think normally we just tell each other, ‘Just play it simple, make the simple play,” [head coach Dave] Flint tells the D to keep five in front of them and our forwards are always backchecking hard at those times when it’s crucial,” Frankel said. “So I think when the team can come together at the end of the game and play that way, we know we’re going to be successful.”
With less than a minute remaining, the Huskies got a fantastic defensive play from Mueller to seal the win. A shot from Vermont’s Eve-Audrey Picard was saved by Frankel, but the rebound fell invitingly in front of the goal line and looked as though it would slide across. Mueller swung in at the last second and cleared to give the Huskies the win.
“I thought it was going in… I knew Alina had blocked it out pretty well before it had gone in, but that was a big play, and obviously a game-changer,” Flint said.
Frankel’s shutout was her sixth of the year. She made 22 saves, including 12 in the final period when Vermont was pressuring.
“She’s been a rock for us all year,” Flint said. “She didn’t have a ton of saves, but she actually had to make some big-time saves in the third period when the game was on the line. She stepped up.”
The win marks coach Flint’s 200th in charge of Northeastern, becoming only the second coach in program history to reach the mark (Dan McLeod).
“Being a goalie and a goalie guy, I love the fact that we won it 1-0,” Flint said. “I’m obviously happy that I got 200 here at Northeastern, but it’s a testament to this team and how hard they’ve worked this year.”
The Huskies move to the next round with the win and will face the winner of the Providence-Merrimack series next weekend.
“This week in practice is going to be huge for us, obviously to work on special teams and just fine-tune the things we’ve been doing right, but I think we’re in a really good place right now, and I think if we can carry on the energy we had this weekend, I think we’ll be successful next weekend,” Frankel said.
The final two rounds of the tournament will be held at Providence’s Schneider Arena, and both the semifinals and the final are one-game sets.
“Next weekend is going to come down to details, obviously if its Providence it’s their home rink so they’re going to give us a tough game,” Anderson said. “I think the difference between Matthews and home ice and Providence’s rink is very significant.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/58277/sports/womens-hockey-beats-vermont-7-2-on-the-back-of-seven-different-scorers/,Women’s hockey beats Vermont 7-2 on the back of seven different scorers,"Mike Puzzanghera, sports editor","March 1, 2019","Northeastern’s Hockey East playoff campaign began with a bang Friday, as they got five multi-point performances on their way to a 7-2 win over Vermont in the first of a best-of-three series.
The Huskies (24-5-5, 21-3-3 WHEA) faced off against the Catamounts (10-19-6, 8-15-4 WHEA) at Matthews Arena for their first playoff game of the season. After a strong regular season, the Huskies claimed the top seed in the conference, matching them up with eighth-seeded Vermont in the first round.
With less than six minutes off the clock, the Huskies got the start they were hoping for, with sophomore forward Veronika Pettey finishing off a beautiful cross from Skylar Fontaine. Fontaine won the puck in the neutral zone and raced ahead with Pettey and Matti Hartman, making cuts to the net. Fontaine found Pettey all alone at the back post and she did not miss, placing her one-timer low past Vermont goalkeeper Blanka Skodova.
Less than a minute later the Huskies had two, with senior forward Kasidy Anderson scoring unassisted at 6:36. Anderson chased down Vermont defender Ellice Murphy and won the puck, breaking through on goal with only Skodova to beat. She waited for an opening and found one between the legs of Skodova, scoring her 19th of the year and giving NU a two-goal lead.
NU would not stop the early onslaught, finding a third goal on the power play. Fontaine took a pass from junior forward Andrea Renner and, thanks to a great screen in front by Mia Brown, she was able to rifle a shot past Skodova at the near post. The goal caused a goalkeeping change for Vermont, with Melissa Black replacing Skodova.
“We were just moving the puck quick, I got it from Renner and held it, and they drop a lot, so I held it for one more second and there was just no one there so I shot,” Fontaine said.
Vermont fought back late in the period, scoring two goals to tighten the game up. The first came from forward Alyssa Holmes, who received a pass in front and made no mistake in firing low past NU goalkeeper Aerin Frankel.
Forward Corinne McCool scored the second for the Catamounts, dangling past a NU defender and finding space on the rush to beat Frankel five-hole.
After losing their early momentum, the Huskies desperately needed the break at the end of the first to regroup and come back out stronger.
“We tell them, ‘It’s playoffs; anything can happen and we can’t lay down, because the other team’s not going to stop,’” assistant coach Lindsay Berman said. “We knew that we had to come out the next period the way we did to start the game, and they did, so they responded well.”
At the start of the second, the Huskies restored their earlier two-goal advantage with a goal from sophomore defender Brooke Hobson. Anderson played her pass across to Alina Mueller, who got a slight touch to play it on for Hobson, who had acres of space on the left. She launched a wrister off the pipe and in for the Huskies’ fourth of the game and her sixth of the year.
The Huskies wasted no time in getting their lead back up to three, as junior defender Codie Cross scored her first of the year on the power play. Fontaine played a pass across to Hartman, who immediately turned to set up Cross at the point. Cross lined up a slap shot and she roofed her shot to beat Black.
“One of our keys is just moving the puck fast, and we did a really good job at that, and luckily I just got it off my stick and it went in, which was really exciting,” Cross said.
NU would get their third of the period and sixth of the game at 15:47 from sophomore forward Katie Cipra. Renner redirected a pass from junior defender Paige Capistran into Cipra’s line of fire, and she slipped her shot past Black.
At the end of the second, the Huskies had totalled 28 shots on goal, peppering both Skodova and Black with efforts. Black fared much better than Skodova did despite both giving up three goals, making 19 saves compared to Skodova’s three. The Huskies remained on the front foot as the teams went into the locker room.
“I think our team does a really good job at always coming back when we get scored on, that’s just one thing our team does really well, and I don’t think anyone ever gets down so we just know to push it forward,” Cross said.
“We always pick each other up, no matter what,” Fontaine added.
Skodova replaced Black at the start of the third, however, and the Huskies beat her for goal number seven. Fontaine took a low point shot with Brown making a screen in front again, but this time the freshman got a touch on the shot, redirecting with her stick to lift the puck over Skodova for her fourth goal of the season.
Fontaine finished the night with four points, a career high for her and the Huskies’ third four-point effort of the season (Mueller and Chloe Aurard). Cross finished with three points on a goal and two assists and Renner, Anderson and Hartman all had two points.
“We talked about it in the locker room just now, it’s really important to get contributions from the entire team from the goal line out, and to see that many of our players on the score sheet is awesome,” Berman said.
The Huskies’ seven goals are a season-high. The seven scorers narrowly beat out the six they had in a game against Merrimack Feb. 8.
“I think it’s really important that we all know we’re all a huge part of our team’s success and everyone scoring tonight had a huge impact on our team,” Fontaine said. “It’s a big unity thing on our team.”
Northeastern will face Vermont again Saturday at Matthews in the second game of the best-of-three.
“We have a midnight rule,” Berman said. “So today, they go home and they have to forget about this and then move on with a clean slate tomorrow. We know tomorrow when we come back, Vermont’s going to be ready to go and we have to counter that.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/58275/sports/baseball-goes-undefeated-in-second-weekend-of-play/,Baseball goes undefeated in second weekend of play,"Jenna Majeski, news correspondent","March 1, 2019","Northeastern headed into its second weekend ready to win, and that they did. They defeated the Missouri Tigers, 4-3 Thursday and the South Dakota State Jackrabbits, 12-9 Saturday and 13-7 Sunday.
This huge offensive output came after a disappointing opening series loss to Houston Baptist last weekend.
“I think we just took the positives out of last weekend and figured out what we needed to do as a team,” redshirt freshman Corey DiLoreto said. 
DiLoreto and sophomore Jeff Costello have been credited by head coach Mike Glavine, as well as some of their teammates, for filling gaps left from last year. Team captain Andrew Misiaszek said that they’ve had a “really hot two weekends.”
Thursday’s game did not begin as NU hoped, as Northeastern gave up two runs in the first inning and trailed 3-0 going into the sixth. 
The Huskies finally found their opportunity in the eighth inning, when the first three batters reached base. A hit by Cam Walsh gave the Huskies one run and a double by Scott Holzwasser tied the game.
Two wild pitches by Tigers pitcher Cameron Dulle allowed Cam Walsh to score the game-winning run.
Misiaszek’s pitching in the eighth and ninth innings prevented the Tigers from coming back. Misiaszek struck out four players in addition to Tyler Brown’s five strikeouts in the first five innings.
The game concluded with the Huskies ahead, 4-3.
“That was a really hard fought game,” Misiaszek said.
Before advancing to their series against South Dakota State, the Huskies played the Boston Red Sox in an exhibition game in Fort Myers, Florida.
The Huskies began their two-game series against South Dakota State Saturday in Port Charlotte, Florida. 
Yet again the Huskies were behind from the beginning, trailing 1-0 after the first. They quickly made up for this by scoring four times in the third inning.
The Huskies tacked on additional runs in the subsequent five innings to win the game, 12-9. Cam Walsh stood out, going 3-for-5 with 3 RBI. Additionally, both DiLoreto and Jeff Costello earned 2 RBI.
Misiaszek again concluded Saturday’s game with a scoreless inning, earning him his 21st career save and tying him with the program record.
“It feels good to be in that role but I’ve got to give credit to the bullpen and starters,” Misiaszek said. “Guys threw eight innings before me so got to give them credit.”
The Huskies had another successful game Sunday, defeating the Jackrabbits 13-7. 
The high-scoring game began with a scoreless first two innings but things quickly changed as the Jackrabbits pulled ahead 2-0 in the top of the third and the Huskies immediately responded with a run.
The Huskies pulled ahead in the fifth with four runs, including an RBI double from Scott Holzwasser, followed by a run-scoring single by Jake Farrell.
The Jackrabbits couldn’t keep up with Northeastern’s scoring as the Huskies piled on another eight runs in the seventh and eighth innings, including two from DiLoreto’s triple in the eighth.
Sean Mellen struck out eight in his four innings. 
“It was a huge weekend for us, another step on the way to becoming a complete team,” DiLoreto said.
The Huskies have another busy weekend as they head to Conway, South Carolina for the CCU Baseball Tournament, where they’ll face Connecticut, Indiana and Illinois.
“This next week and a half is probably our toughest test yet and we’re playing some really good teams down in South Carolina,” Misiaszek said. “But like coach Glavine says, play the team, not the uniform.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/58273/sports/huskies-face-defending-world-champion-red-sox/,Huskies face defending World Champion Red Sox,"Jenna Majeski, news correspondent","March 1, 2019","On Friday, Feb. 22 the Northeastern baseball team became the first team to face the reigning world champion Red Sox since the Dodgers did so in October. The two teams faced off in their annual exhibition game in Fort Myers, Florida.. 
The Huskies lost the seven-inning game, 6-0, but that did not distract them from the value of the opportunity to play the renowned Red Sox, whose home of Fenway Park is just a couple miles from NU’s Parson’s Field.
“A lot of us are local guys who grew up as Red Sox fans so that was a lot of fun,” redshirt freshman Corey DiLoreto said.
Northeastern tried out five pitchers against the defending champions, beginning with redshirt junior Kyle Murphy who stopped the Red Sox from scoring.
Sophomore David Stiehl took over on the mound for the second inning, allowing a Bobby Dalbec home run before adding three straight outs that ended the inning. Following his performance were redshirt sophomore Tom Githens, sophomore Sam Jacobsak and freshman Owen Langan.
Despite the Huskies’ strong effort in challenging the Red Sox, only three players registered hits: John Mazza, DiLoreto and Scott Holzwasser.
“That’s one of the highlights of the year for our team,” head coach Mike Glavine said.
Challenging the defending champion Red Sox is especially notable as the first World Series was played on the current Northeastern campus, at the site formerly known as the Huntington Avenue Grounds, between the Boston Red Sox (formerly Boston Americans) and the Pittsburgh Pirates.
Today a statue of pitcher Cy Young stands at the former home plate outside the Cabot Center and marks a notable point in Northeastern’s history."
https://huntnewsnu.com/58203/sports/after-ankle-injury-nu-student-starts-video-company-to-help-other-student-athletes/,"After ankle injury, NU student starts video company to help other student athletes","Joe Lantow, news correspondent","March 1, 2019","As college acceptance rates at schools like Northeastern drop, for many students the path to college lies in not just academic achievement, but athletic ability. This is where Lucas Espada, a first-year business student, found himself last year.
“All throughout high school, I was trying to get recruited to Division I,” Espada said. “I started the process senior year, but it’s tough. As I was trying to market my skills sending highlight videos, I was getting no responses. I did some research, found that college coaches get around 2,500 emails a day — and figured I needed to rise above the noise. I started mixing soundtracks from my favorite movies and syncing the climax of the songs with my highlight videos.”
Espada’s approach and dedication allowed him to rise above that noise and he was recruited to play soccer as a goalie for Harvard — until an unexpected injury senior year. For most people, a severe ankle injury is enough to cause serious pain. For a high school athlete getting recruited to Harvard on athletics, it can feel like the end of the world.
“For a while, I was wondering why I went through all this. The rejection honestly hurt a lot,” Espada said.
He’s channeled his collegiate athletics ambition a different way. Espada’s startup, CAPTIV, uses his unique approach to recruitment videos in order to help other high school athletes capture the attention of recruiters.
“CAPTIV is an entertainment company based on the spread of passion,” Espada said. “We currently specialize in highlight videos for collegiate athletes. At our core, we spread passion. We paint stories rather than just talent.”
After starting CAPTIV, Espada, who attended Northeastern instead of Harvard, discovered Husky Startup, a semester-long business pitch competition at the university.
“You go through a series of boot camps taking this concept from an idea to launch,” Espada said. “Eventually, during demo day the top 12 ventures got to pitch live at the Curry Ballroom. I got to pitch CAPTIV live on the day as a finalist in front of 500 people.”
Husky Startup allowed Espada to create and refine his vision for the new startup. After the pitch, CAPTIV grew from a small startup run just by Espada to a five-person crew.
“I learned Lucas was running CAPTIV through the Husky Startup Challenge,” said Joe Chou, a first-year business major and chief operating officer of CAPTIV. “After talking to him about the company I knew it was something I wanted to do. My passion for both the sports and the business aspect meant I knew I could help.”
Chou isn’t the only CAPTIV member inspired by the intersection of sports and business. Max Geott, a first-year business major and chief administrative officer of CAPTIV, felt similarly. He and Espada met through on-campus clubs, and when Geott heard of CAPTIV he knew he had to join.
“I tried to run a bunch of sports pages in high school, and I saw the process kids were going through to be recruited,” Geott said. “Once I got here I was wondering — what’s a world where I can combine the analytical things I want to do while being involved in my passion, which is sports.”
Espada is driven by the project and willing to go as far as this journey takes him.
“This is something that combines every aspect of what I love to do,” Espada said. “It’s creating something new, and it’s doing it while having fun. I could absolutely see myself doing CAPTIV 10 years from now, taking it into new markets. I’m an entrepreneurship major — this is what I do.”
So far, CAPTIV’s number of clients only ranges in the double digits – but Chou is confident in the future of the company.
“When you start a startup you have to believe in your own company — otherwise what is the point of starting it?” Chou said. “You have to be able to go all in.”
Geott shares similar aspirations and emphasizes how thinking for the future is part of CAPTIV’s strategy.
“One of the big things we did at the start of the year was thinking big,” Geott said. “Everyone was thinking huge — media conglomerates, highlight videos, music videos. We have to act small now because that’s how we plan to get attention locally. But in 10 years? I’m excited.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/58193/city-pulse/mbtas-better-bus-project-could-boost-low-income-communities/,MBTA’s Better Bus Project could boost low-income communities,"George Barker, news correspondent","February 27, 2019","Boston commuters spend an average of 164 hours stuck in traffic per year, making Boston the most congested city in the country, according to the INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard. Now ranked as the seventh most congested city in the world, Boston is exploring a variety of options to relieve its rush hour crawl. The Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority, or MBTA, hopes its bus system will contribute to improvements. 
But before buses can begin to solve Boston’s heightening traffic problem, they will need major adjustments. The MBTA is beginning the Better Bus Project, meant to solve some of the largest issues facing the bus service. Those in charge of the project have their work cut out for them as currently, buses are the weakest wing of the MBTA.
Despite the fact that 30 percent of MBTA users utilize the bus service, the reliability of buses lags far behind both the commuter rail and subway lines, where trains arrive on schedule at a rate approaching 90 percent, not including stops affected by bus shuttles in place of train stations under construction. 
Buses meet the MBTA’s own reliability targets of 75 percent just 14 percent of the time, with “non-key” routes meeting targets only 9 percent of the time. The MBTA aims to improve this rate, but not all issues slowing down buses are within its control.
“One of the biggest challenges we’ve seen with buses is the challenge of them being held back by highly congested streets. Approximately seven miles of streets are holding back about 90,000 riders,” said Kristiana Lachiusa, who works for the LivableStreets Alliance, a Cambridge-based transportation advocacy group. Roughly 355,000 people ride the bus on an average weekday. 
The Better Bus Project aims to limit the negative effects of high traffic on buses through multiple bus priority initiatives. The MBTA is still exploring dedicated bus lanes and traffic signal priority systems in surrounding commuter towns and cities to alleviate the effects of rush hour traffic on the timeliness of key bus routes. The hope is that by improving buses’ efficiency, more commuters will turn to the bus and subsequently lower traffic congestion. 
Bus lanes were found to be quite effective in Arlington, where the 77 bus route carried an average of 3,635 riders down Massachusetts Avenue per day in 2014.
“If I take the bus after 7:30, there’s a ton of rush hour traffic, so I’ll usually be late,” said Maren Larkin, a resident of Arlington who regularly takes the 77 bus to school. “If there wasn’t such a significant amount of rush hour traffic, then I wouldn’t have to leave my house 30 or 45 minutes before I have to be at school. Because of the traffic, my commute takes almost twice as long as it does during less busy times of day.”
Larkin is far from the only bus user adversely affected by traffic. Nearly 85 percent of commuters found their trip to be completed faster with the lane in place, and just under 95 percent wanted the lane to be made permanent. One of the busiest corridors of the 77 bus route, which was in the 90th percentile for delays, found a travel time reduction of more than 10 minutes while reducing variability of travel times by 40 percent. Dedicated bus lanes can greatly improve the service of key routes that thousands of Boston area residents rely on for their daily commutes. 
There are also internal factors the MBTA hopes to address to improve service. The MBTA’s State of the Bus System says that absent bus operators lead to cancelled routes and also cites outdated schedules as reasons buses fail to remain on schedule. 
Part of the Better Bus Project is aimed at resolving outdated and repetitive bus routes, hoping to consolidate routes to improve service. Currently, there are 47 proposals to alter existing bus routes, with many of these proposals coming directly from the community that uses them. Unlike major infrastructure updates, changing the bus schedule may allow the MBTA to quickly improve service to some of its weakest routes. Additionally, the MBTA aims to hire more bus operators in the coming years. 
Despite the effectiveness of dedicated bus lanes in surrounding communities, Boston is lagging behind in fully implementing the program within the city. Although the lanes are beginning to emerge, the majority of the city does not yet have any dedicated lanes. With the MBTA experiencing another large budget deficit, the Boston city government is engaging in a funding battle with the state government, attempting to secure $140,000 to create the lanes throughout the city rather than moving forward with the project immediately. 
While Boston fights for additional state support, its low-income residents are suffering. As the MBTA’s cheapest transit option, buses often serve residents who have no other viable method of commuting to their jobs. The MBTA found that 78 percent of bus users use the bus service to commute to work or school, while 39 percent of bus users do not have any cars in their household, while another 21 percent have less than one car for every two people in a household. 
“When you’re looking at the equity perspective, and you couple that with the neighborhoods such as Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattapan, which really have limited access to rapid transit, so a lot of them are really reliant on bus and trolleys,” Lachiusa said. “We have some neighborhoods which are forced to take bus trips, and our buses are held back by congestion and can not get riders where they need to go when they need to get there.” 
Despite a clear reliance on bus service for the low-income working population in Boston, more than 50 percent of jobs within the MBTA service area are not accessible via a bus route offering all-day service. For those who work irregular hours, like cashiers, security guards and workers in the food service industry, this lack of all-day coverage can significantly limit the mobility of bus commuters. 
“The frequency and reliability of buses is really the strong theme that comes up when we speak with bus riders and really needs to be addressed in order for people to have access to opportunity, get to affordable housing and do whatever they need to do,” Lachiusa said. 
Regardless of income, inconsistent service can be extremely frustrating to all commuters who rely on the T. But given that 42 percent of bus users were found to be low-income, significantly higher than the subway’s rate of 26 percent and the commuter rail’s 7 percent, poor bus service is more limiting to low-income Boston residents. However, the Better Bus Project may be able to increase income and job opportunities for the service’s regular commuters. 
“Increased ridership for residential users is usually generated because you’re taking people to their places of employment and therefore enabling otherwise isolated neighborhoods to generate more revenue within the neighborhood because people are employed at better jobs and have more access and opportunity to be employed in higher paying jobs,” said Professor Ted Landsmark, director of the Kitty and Michael Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy and a former member of the MBTA Board of Directors who oversaw the expansion of the Red Line. 
Although buses have been more frequently used as an “interim way” of transporting commuters toward the subway, the Better Bus Project could improve buses to the point where they will be as swift as Boston’s subways, which would hopefully bring forth the same level of economic development seen in areas like Davis Square following the extension of the Red Line through Somerville. 
“The extension of [any subway lines], both historically and more recently, has always encouraged some kind of economic development,” Landsmark said. “There is an assumption that when you put faster service into place, economic development will take place.”
With Boston and the surrounding area ranking inside the top 10 for income inequality in 2016, improving bus service may allow for the city to address not just issues with traffic, but also inequality within both the city limits and the metropolitan area. Given that the Better Bus Project is still far from over, with most of the proposed changes not expected to come into effect until the end of 2019 or even 2020, riders can continue to expect unreliable service. But with more than $8 billion dedicated to revamping the MBTA, riders can hope that the long-neglected bus service will soon more efficiently serve its users and provide an economic boost to neighborhoods reliant on the bus service."

Change can be tough, specifically when it involves moving away from friends and family to pursue an opportunity somewhere else.
This is what transfer athletes at any university go through. At Northeastern, it is usually unknown how the athletic transfer process compares to one of the everyday student, and how it affects the players themselves. A non-athlete student will use the Common Application to apply as a transfer to other schools. An athlete, however, goes through a process that is a lot more involved, with paperwork involving being released from the team they are on to enable them to talk with other schools who may be interested in them. Another unknown is the motivation for some of these players to change their lifestyles by transferring. 
Austin Plevy, Brandon Hawkins and Jordan Roland, who are Division I transfer athletes at Northeastern, spoke of their experience with the transfer process.
Austin Plevy, men’s hockey senior
Plevy is a forward on the Northeastern men’s hockey team from Langley, British Columbia. He played for UMass before transferring to Northeastern at the end of the 2017-18 season. So far in the 2018-19 season, he has played in 31 games for the Huskies, scoring three goals and three assists. He also scored the first goal in the Beanpot final against Boston College.
Plevy’s best year came during the 2015-16 season, when he was still at UMass, when he played in 35 games, scoring 10 goals and 14 assists. 
The News: What was your motive in switching schools?
Austin Plevy: Lots of things go into it. I was at UMass Amherst for three years, [and] I was there for a coaching change. Some stuff just happened and I had the credits to graduate in three years, and I had the ability to transfer to Northeastern. It was the opportunity for a fresh start [and] to do grad school. That’s what was it for me.
TN: What has the transfer process been like for you, and how have you adapted to your new team?
AP: For me it went pretty smooth actually. I had help from my parents, they were with me the whole time trying to figure out the process. Obviously when I was at UMass and we started that process they would help to get the paperwork and to get you officially out the door so you can talk to other schools. Once that was done … Northeastern contacted me pretty quickly, and I was pretty excited about that. I wanted to stay in the New England area. Obviously Northeastern is an unbelievable school … so I was very fortunate.
TN: How much support is given to students through the admissions process? How much has athletics helped with the transition?
AP: I don’t know how that works. I think in my situation, being a graduate student might have [made it] a little easier because there’s not as many people getting into graduate school. And obviously they had the spot on the hockey team for me. So I look back and think about it but I can’t think of a challenging time, like I said Northeastern was extremely helpful. I hoped they were excited to have me coming in, so if there was something that needed to get pushed along I think Coach [Jim] Madigan probably had that done. There is no special treatment or anything like that. You have to get the paperwork done on time, you have deadlines, you’ve got to do it right and get it submitted and then get it through.
TN: What was it like to leave Canada to come and play hockey in the United States? Was that process similar to transferring schools?
AP: I guess so. For me … I grew up in an area that was dominated by the Western League major junior, so not the college route. But I was lucky to have people around me that have been through it and they pushed me to the college route. They understood that the opportunity to get a free degree from an American school was incredible. So that was great. I think that being from Canada and moving down to the U.S was never that big of a deal for me … [because] I moved away at 17 or 18. So I have been away from home for a while. Like I said, having the opportunity to come to a U.S. school, and having the opportunities I have had have been incredible. You get lots of coverage now in Canada. There’s lots of news, like the Beanpot game was on TV and TSN. I think we have five or six games a year now on TSN. So it’s becoming more popular in Canada which is great because I would like to see more kids growing up and going the college route and having the opportunities that I have had.
TN: How were the first few months after the transfer?
AP: Obviously coming into a new place, I played in Hockey East for three years so I knew of lots of guys on the team. I had never met them personally. The first day you show up, the guys, the coaches, the support staff, the trainers, are all incredible people. So it was different for me leaving UMass where I was very comfortable with everyone I had been around to a new everything. New city, dorms, food, everything. The guys especially made it very easy for me, they obviously come up and introduce themselves, they get to know you, they want to know you. You’re a part of the family now, the brotherhood of being at Northeastern. I was a little nervous for sure coming in, but it couldn’t have went any smoother. The guys have been fantastic.
Brandon Hawkins, men’s hockey senior
Hawkins is a forward on the Northeastern men’s hockey team from Macomb Township, Michigan. He played for Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, before transferring to Northeastern after the 2015-16 season. After sitting out due to NCAA regulations, he started his NU career halfway through the 2017-18 season. He appeared in 22 games, in which he had five goals and 12 assists. His best season with Northeastern is the current one, in which he has appeared in 31 games, scoring eight goals and 17 assists. 
The News: What was your motive in switching schools?
Brandon Hawkins: Going into why I transferred, some things were said that might not have been okay to be said at times. I’ll leave it in that terms, but I needed a fresh start somewhere else. When I look back at it, I had a lot of work that I put in at Bowling Green and it gave me the opportunity to transfer here. So, my motive was mostly a new start.
TN: What has the transfer process been like for you, and how have you adapted to your new team?
BH: Mine was a bit more difficult than Austin’s because he was already graduated and he had all of his credits done. When I transferred I had to get a release from Bowling Green which took about two weeks. I then had to withdraw from the semester that I was in there so I ended up … losing almost a quarter of the credits that I had at Bowling Green. But, my advisor helped me from school, and then my advisor that helps me within hockey talked to Northeastern and got the ball rolling in which I came on a visit. And then we started to get my transfer credits and that whole spiel ready. It was a long process but I wouldn’t say it was a hard one. It went pretty smooth.
TN: Is the transfer process for athletes similar to the transfer process for a regular student? What do you think are the differences there?
BH: It is but it isn’t, because when it comes to being an athlete, you have to have a certain amount of percentage done towards your degree in order to be eligible to play. So, if you transfer in and your credits don’t transfer with you, that takes away from your percentage towards graduation. If you don’t reach that percentage, then you will be ineligible to play until you get that percentage back.
TN: How much support is given to students through the admissions process? How much has athletics helped with the transition?
BH: As long as you keep to the deadlines and you get things done the way they are supposed to be done … it is a pretty easy process. I don’t think that we get too much help other than coach [Jim Madigan] asking if we’re getting our stuff done on time. So, if they see you getting your stuff done on time, they understand that you want to be here. If you show that you want to be here then they’re going to make it happen.
TN: Was the transition from Michigan to Bowling Green similar to the transfer process from Bowling Green to Northeastern?
BH: I originally committed [to Bowling Green] because my dad has an extremely bad back, so he has a hard time getting around. It was only an hour and a half away from my house, so for him to come to games was a lot easier. Going there, I committed a lot on the premise that it was close to home. When transferring out here, I wanted to play here when I originally thought of playing college hockey when I was playing juniors, and I never got the chance because I committed so early to even talk to Northeastern. So, the second that I left Bowling Green, this was the first place that I wanted to go. When that happened, as soon as I talked to them it was kind of like a dream come true, because this was the place that I wanted to play all along, and I finally got the opportunity to do that.
TN: How were the first few months after the transfer?
BH: I came in at Christmas time. A team has that chance to bond from September to December, and I wasn’t a part of that at any time. I was back home just training on my own and doing my own thing. So when I got here, I specifically remember … they all welcomed me in like I was family right away. When I got here I instantly felt like I was part of the team. So that was huge … [and] it was almost like I was a part of the family. When I came in, [I was] kind of nervous, trying to fit in and doing different things like that, so they made it very easy for me.
Jordan Roland, men’s basketball junior
Roland is a guard on the Northeastern men’s basketball team from Syracuse, New York. He played for George Washington University in Washington, D.C., before transferring to Northeastern after the 2016-17 season. Due to an NCAA transfer rule, he had to sit out the 2017-18 season, but he jumped into the 2018-19 season and has posted great numbers so far. 
Roland is averaging 14.3 points per game, the highest of his collegiate career. His field goal percentage lies at .441 while his three-point percentage is slightly lower at .403. His free throw percentage is .889. His best game of the season came on Nov. 9 in a win over Harvard, when he scored 35 points and shot .692 from the field.
The News: What was your motive for deciding to leave your old school and come to Northeastern?
Jordan Roland: There was a lot going on at my old school. There was a coaching change. That was probably the biggest reason. There was a lot surrounding it, I don’t know if I want to get to deep into it. I just decided it was time to go. There was a coaching change and I was one of a lot of kids to leave, so I decided it was probably best for me to go a separate way.
TN: What was the transfer process like, and how have you adapted to Northeastern?
JR: The transfer process was smooth. I got recruited by a couple of schools, and decided to pick Northeastern. Coming to Northeastern I think was a really smooth transition. I think the team is pretty welcoming, I like the staff and I like the guys. Having a redshirt year was nice to just having that year to get acclimated to the school before having to play. No complaints at all about the transfer process.
TN: How much support is given to students through the admissions process? How has athletics helped with that process?
JR: I don’t remember any issues with admissions. I came into the school, [and] some credits didn’t make it through. But it was pretty smooth overall. 
TN: What were the first few months after your transfer like?
JR: After I decided to transfer I was still on campus at George Washington, so those couple of months were kind of awkward. I had two months at home and it was kind of weird being a sophomore having already been at school for two years and not going back to the same place. [It] was almost like you’re coming in as a freshman again. My first month here, I really liked it. For Summer II, pretty much our whole team was here, and getting acclimated to the guys was pretty nice. Working out with everybody, I thought it was good.
TN: What would you say the key differences are between being a Division I athlete at Northeastern versus being a Division I athlete at another school?
JR: I would assume it is probably pretty similar. Obviously depending on what level you’re at, I’m sure the guys at Syracuse get a lot more than we do, and we’re probably treated a little better than some lower major schools. But, between George Washington and Northeastern, the two were pretty comparable. I wouldn’t say there is anything special about it, but there’s nothing bad about it either, it’s just normal.
TN: What was the transition like when leaving home to play basketball at George Washington? And was that transition similar to the process of transferring from George Washington to Northeastern?
JR: I think the major difference between those two things is just going to George Washington as a freshman, that was my first time being away from home. So, that was definitely a little tougher. I lived at home my whole life, I didn’t go to a prep school or anything. I had to leave in the summer too, so that was the senior summer with all of my friends, so that was really sad to see all of my friends at home having fun while I was working out at GW. But, similar thing transferring, you have to meet new people and make new friendships, but having already been away from home for two years I think made that transition a little easier. I was just acclimating to a new place."
https://huntnewsnu.com/58183/sports/preview-womens-hockey-to-take-on-vermont-in-hockey-east-playoffs/,Women’s hockey to take on Vermont in Hockey East playoffs,"Mike Puzzanghera, sports editor","February 27, 2019","Northeastern’s No. 3 rank in the national poll says enough about how good they have been this year. They blew through Hockey East, clinching the regular season title with three games to play. They’ve won games against all five of the teams they’ve played in the top-10 of the Pairwise: Clarkson, Boston University (twice), Boston College (twice), Colgate and Providence (twice). They’ve earned a home series for the first round of the conference playoffs against Vermont.
Vermont, however, had to play well in its last few games in order to ensure a place in the Hockey East playoffs, sneaking in as the eighth seed. They swept Holy Cross commandingly over two home games before pulling off a draw against Maine in a crucial game — if Maine won, they would have taken the last playoff spot.
The two teams face off in a best-of-three at Matthews Arena this weekend, with games set for Friday and Saturday with a third on Sunday if necessary. Northeastern (23-5-5, 21-3-3 WHEA) will be looking to utilize their home-ice advantage, but they’ll need to get past the Catamounts (10-18-6, 8-15-4 WHEA), who come in undefeated in their last four.
Expect pressure from the Huskies
In three games against the Catamounts this season, the Huskies scored 11 goals and registered 101 shots on net. Those goals include three from Veronika Pettey, two from Andrea Renner and six from six other players.
Vermont goalkeeper Melissa Black kept her team in the game in two out of the three meetings this season. Black was pulled after the first period in the first matchup after giving up three goals and only making seven saves, but she rebounded well in the final two meetings. 
Black made 35 saves in Northeastern’s 2-1 overtime win on Jan. 25, losing her shutout bid with only a few minutes left in regulation before getting the loss after Brooke Hobson’s overtime point shot flew past her.
The next day, Black was faced with another onslaught from the Northeastern attack, and she did not fare as well as she did the prior night. The Huskies scored five times, including a hat trick from Pettey, and went on to win, 5-1. Despite the result, Black played well, making 31 saves. Without her in net, Vermont may have been subject to quite a few more Husky goals.
Top two penalty killers
Vermont finishes the regular season with the top-ranked penalty kill in the conference — the Catamounts have only allowed 11 power-play goals on 112 attempts for a .902 kill rate.
Likewise, the Huskies have also excelled at killing penalties. After only giving up 12 power-play goals during the regular season, they head into the playoffs with a .898 penalty kill rate, second in the conference.
Despite how close the two teams are in terms of kill rates, the Huskies look to hold the advantage. Northeastern’s power play has been more successful than Vermont’s, scoring on 17.2 percent of opportunities compared to Vermont’s 12.3 percent.
The Huskies also have one of the best power-play scorers in the NCAA in Pettey. The forward has seven power-play goals to her name this year, which is the top mark in Hockey East and tied for second in the NCAA. The unit of Pettey, Kasidy Anderson, Alina Mueller, Chloe Aurard, and Hobson — the Huskies’ first line on power plays — has combined for 16 power-play goals on the season.
It will certainly be a test for the Vermont penalty kill unit to face off against the Huskies’ power-play unit, but if the Catamounts can hold strong, they can take away one of NU’s key sources of goals.
NU’s rock at the back
It’s no secret that Northeastern’s Aerin Frankel has been one of the top goalkeepers in the NCAA this season. In 24 games, she has racked up 17 wins and five shutouts (T-6th in NCAA). Her .932 save percentage took a hit after Saturday’s 4-4 tie at Merrimack, but she is still 12th in the NCAA and third in Hockey East. Among goalkeepers with at least 20 decisions, her .804 win percentage is third in the NCAA and at the top of Hockey East. Her 1.833 goals against average is 12th in the country even after taking a hit Saturday.
Despite that abnormally shaky performance against Merrimack, Frankel has been a rock in every game this season. Her 46 saves Nov. 27 against Boston College kept the Huskies in the game and allowed them to take the win in overtime. In her first game of the year, she shut out Boston University on the road with 28 saves, getting an assist to boot. Her ability to stifle strong attacks will be crucial in Northeastern’s playoff run. 
Though a bit off-form as of late, she did stop 31 shots in a 4-1 win at Providence to clinch the Hockey East regular season title. Frankel is always capable of the near-impossible. Her lunging stick save the night after the Providence game against the same team sticks out, as it stunned Matthews Arena (and the press box).
Across three games against Vermont, Frankel only gave up three goals. If she can regain her form from earlier in the year and bring her A-game for the playoffs, the Huskies won’t have much to worry about at the back."

Deconfounders are methods that determine the extent to which one thing is the cause of another using weaker assumptions than classical methods, and are relevant in fields like the social sciences where it is difficult to control for possible causes. Blei emphasized how complicated data is in the modern world.
“We have people that connect to each other, that send messages to each other, they’re clicking on those messages et cetera et cetera, these are all ways data is [more] complicated than it was 20 years ago,” Blei said.
Blei used data about movies to study causal effects of actors, like Meryl Streep affecting movie revenue. He showed that this question can take advantage of deconfounders because it is not a “classical causal problem” but one with multiple causes where an actor is only one possible factor.
Blei said that his general field, probabilistic machine learning, builds methods that connect domain knowledge to data we collect about the world; that answers the question, “What does it mean to make sense of data?”
“Traditionally in machine learning it means something about making a prediction about the future … most ambitiously we might want to do real science: confirm, elaborate or form causal theories,” Blei said. “Or put in plain English, I want to know how the world works based on this data. I want to ingest this data about Facebook and I want to understand something about how people connect and form relationships.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/58156/lifestyle/community-concerts-bring-boston-symphony-orchestra-to-campus/,Community concerts bring Boston Symphony Orchestra to campus,"Deanna Schwartz, news staff","February 27, 2019","Those who want to hear classical music played by world-renowned musicians need not look any further than St. Stephen Street.
Two to three times a semester, the music of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, or BSO, can be heard on campus in the Fenway Center.
The BSO Community Chamber Music Series concerts are each comprised of four or five BSO musicians performing classical pieces at no cost to attendees. The concerts, which run about an hour, include music by the likes of Mozart, Debussy, Monteverdi and more.
Community concerts have long been a part of the orchestra’s programming but have not always been held on campus. The BSO approached Northeastern’s Department of Music in 2010 to host community concerts at the Fenway Center when they outgrew their prior space in Symphony Hall.
While Northeastern students do not perform in the concerts, several participate by providing introductions and archival recordings.
Professors nominate one exceptional music student per concert to introduce the event. These students are usually nominated based on their creativity and public speaking skills, said Arthur Rishi, concert coordinator for the music department. Rishi acts as a liaison between the BSO and Northeastern, coordinating the logistics. 
“We think of this as a pretty big opportunity for our students to be working with the Boston Symphony,” Rishi said.
Ileeana Johnson, a second-year music and psychology double major, served as the student speaker at a concert in February 2018. Johnson said that writing and delivering her concert introduction was difficult and stressful but eventually rewarding. The experience gave her insight into what it takes to organize a concert.
“You don’t realize how much work goes into [putting on concerts]. It’s given me a stronger appreciation for the people who do those kinds of things,” Johnson said. “It’s a super cool, unique experience.”
Students from Green Line Records, Northeastern’s student-run record label, participate by recording the concerts for the BSO’s archives. 
“It was great to get a front row seat to this performance, and it is pretty cool to say I have recorded the BSO in some fashion,” said third-year music industry major Zac Kerwin, head of recording for Green Line. Kerwin recorded the Jan. 11 BSO concert.
Professor Daniel S. Godfrey, chair of the music department, said the concerts help students apply what they learn in class in a unique way. 
“It’s a good opportunity for them to have what they do in terms of learning about repertoire actually serve a function for the public,” Godfrey said.
Godfrey and Rishi said the concert series is a “superb” way to connect with the local community. 
“We’re always looking for ways to connect what we do in the classroom with what is going on in the community around us,” Godfrey said. “[The concerts] get students and people from the community in the same room, listening together.”
BSO Community Chamber Concert audiences are generally about half Northeastern community members and half Bostonians unaffiliated with NU, Rishi said. 
“We always make a point of welcoming them to campus, because they often do not know they are on Northeastern’s campus,” Rishi said. “It’s been a great way for the music department to reach out to the community.”
The next BSO Community Chamber Concerts are on March 15 and April 12 in the Fenway Center."

https://huntnewsnu.com/58120/campus/students-use-mri-technology-to-study-animals-brain-activity/,Students use MRI technology to study animals’ brain activity,"Rachel Powell, news correspondent","February 27, 2019","The Center for Translational NeuroImaging, or CTNI, at Northeastern provides students the ability to conduct research using powerful MRI technology. 
Craig Ferris, a professor of psychology and pharmaceutical sciences, oversees 12 to 14 undergraduate students each semester as they conduct various projects, many of which they design themselves, involving animal models such as mice, rats, voles, hamsters and small monkeys. 
Many research projects at CTNI focus on neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, while others study chemotherapy in pediatrics, mild repetitive traumatic brain injury, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, treatments. 
The lab uses magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, technology to measure brain activity and has access to a functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, scanner. While fMRI reveals the metabolic function of the brain, MRI shows its anatomical structure. 
“MRI is an incredibly powerful technology that’s being used in all health fields,” Ferris said. “It’s a non-invasive technology that can follow a brain from the time it’s here on earth until the time it dies.”
Ferris meets with the students working in his lab every Monday to discuss magnetic resonance physics and engineering. During the week, they use video conferences to keep each other updated on their progress and data accumulation. The goal of each project is to ultimately write and publish a paper.
One project team at CTNI is analyzing the effects of chronic cannabis exposure on brain activity. The team leader of the study, James Coleman, is a third-year behavioral neuroscience major, and he started at CTNI during his co-op there in July 2018. 
For this study, Coleman’s team put dry herb cannabis into a vaporizer, placed mice in a box, and exposed them to the drug for 30 minutes every day for 28 days. They then scanned each mouse’s brain to look for differences in brain activity, especially between males and females. By using adolescent animals, they can identify the ways in which early chronic use of cannabis affects the development and function of the central nervous system.
“The other really cool thing that we’re doing is we’re increasing the translational value of this animal research, because when you look at the state of the literature on cannabis right now, there have been a lot of preclinical studies in animals with cannabis, but the vast majority of them have been using injected THC,” Coleman said. “And when you think about that, how does that translate to humans?”
Coleman said this marijuana study is relevant, especially in Massachusetts, because the number of recreational marijuana dispensaries in the state has been increasing since the legalization of recreational marijuana in 2016. Furthermore, it is the most frequently used illicit drug in the United States according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse
“It’s important that we have these, not only rigorous and controlled, but translatable studies in animals so we can better understand the long term effects, especially at an early age, and the long-term developmental effects associated with cannabis use,” Coleman said. “It’s really important that people have the science and have at least some idea of the actual effects on their brains, so they can know what they’re getting into if they choose to use it recreationally, medically, whatever the case may be.”
Christopher ButlerThe CNTI facility is located in the Mugar Life Sciences Building.
CTNI is also conducting a diabetes study, and the team leader of this project is Chris Lawson, a fourth-year behavioral neuroscience major. Diabetes can be detrimental to an individual’s veins and arteries, so Lawson’s team hypothesized that the disease would also affect a person’s brain connectivity. For this study, the team obtained rats with Type 2 diabetes and conducted imaging protocols. Next, they will analyze the data and compare the brains of the diabetic rats to those of the control rats. 
“The psychological effects of diabetes are not usually as highlighted as some of the other effects,” Lawson said. “Diabetes is a major problem that affects a lot of people, and the better we can understand it, the better treatment they can get.”
Another project at CTNI compares the effects of Adderall and Ritalin, two drugs that are prescribed to treat ADHD and are frequently overprescribed. Jack Demaree, a second-year psychology major, is the team leader of this project. He began working at CTNI during his first semester at Northeastern. 
“Everybody’s there to help everybody else out,” Demaree said. “It’s a group of very highly motivated, very intelligent undergrads and it’s really fun to be a part of.”
Demaree is working on a pharmacological fMRI study, so he and his team use mice to represent a population that does not have ADHD and or prior exposure to drugs. The mice are then administered Adderall or Ritalin for three weeks and then placed into the fMRI scanner, where scans reveal brain function and activity.
“CTNI has its own scanner, which is the biggest resource possible,” Demaree said. “Getting more and more information on what these drugs can do to [an adolescent] brain and somebody who doesn’t have [ADHD] will be very helpful for future medications and diagnoses.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/58148/lifestyle/mfa-exhibits-frida-kahlo-and-arte-popular/,MFA exhibits ‘Frida Kahlo and Arte Popular’,"Evelyn Bleed, news correspondent","February 27, 2019","Mexican self-taught artist Frida Kahlo’s paintings give insight into her tortured mind at the Museum of Fine Arts, or MFA, which previewed its first exhibition of Kahlo’s work on Friday.
The exhibition fills two rooms and was curated by Layla Bermeo. It includes decorated ceramics, embroidered textiles, children’s toys, devotional retablo paintings, Kahlo’s iconic self-portraits and photos for context and storytelling. 
Bermeo guided visitors on a tour, telling stories of the “ambitious” and “ever-evolving painter” while explaining the stories behind some of Kahlo’s notable creations and Bermeo’s thought process in curating the exhibit of rare pieces. 
Upon entering the exhibit, visitors are welcomed with a decorative paper-mache skeleton, a symbol for the Mexican holiday “Día de los Muertos,” or Day of the Dead. A pair of large ceramic pots painted in floral detail stand in the center of the room, as representative examples of the kind of “arte popular” that she would have collected, and behind that, two of Kahlo’s self-portraits. 
Throughout her life, Kahlo collected traditional Mexican folk art — “arte popular” — and drew inspiration from their political significance after the Mexican Revolution. Politicians and artists tried to construct a new narrative for Mexico that spoke to unification. 
Her paintings, most notably her self-portraits, represent questions of identity, postcolonialism, gender, class and race in Mexican society, Bermeo said.
One portrait, “Dos Mujeres,” represents an early milestone in her painting career, while “Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird” was painted during the peak of her career. The two pieces, displayed on opposite ends of a wall in the exhibition, highlight her progress as a painter.
Arte popular influenced Kahlo’s entire career, from her early portraits to her late still-life paintings. Kahlo came to represent a purely Mexican aesthetic, but her inspirations and influences were more complex, Bermeo said. 
Kahlo began seriously making art when she was bedridden after being hit by a trolley. Her life was followed by more disabilities and childhood polio. She made a lot of artwork while she was in bed, where she propped up a canvas above her and enveloped herself in her painting. Her tumultuous marriage to muralist Diego Rivera, her politics and her pain — both internal and external — gave her inspiration.
“She is inspired by folk art, but she is not a folk artist,” Bermeo said. 
A selection of Kahlo’s pieces were loaned by the Museum of Modern Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. 
One of the two rooms showcases Frida’s emblematic “Tehuana” dress, made in the 1930s and 40s in Tehuantepec, Mexico. Kahlo was a member of the middle class from an educated family, and promoted these garments as a show of cultural solidarity.
Photographs of Kahlo at different stages of her life and with artists she collaborated with are also part of the exhibition. Bermeo’s purpose for this was to add context and history of the artist. 
“I tried to be sensitive of the way works [about] Kahlo tend to replace the works by her,” Bermeo said. “The photographs that we included hopefully relate more to the dialogue about her and her work.”
Alongside the main exhibit is “El baño de Frida (Frida’s bathroom),” an intimate collection of photos shot by Graciela Iturbide taken in Kahlo’s bathroom in Mexico City. “Folk Art of the Americas,” a collection of paintings, ceramics and sculptures by various artists, is showcased as well.
The “Frida Kahlo and Arte Popular” exhibition will be open to the public through June 16."

O’Bryant African American Institute.
Lawrencia Raynor, the associate director of the Office of Student Employment, Audrey Grace, the director of diversity and inclusion of the Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion and Anika Crutchfield, a Northeastern University Police Department officer were all recognized. Marcelo A. Araya, a worker in the Facilities Services Department, was also recognized for his service to the institute. 
Richard O’Bryant is the director of the institute, which was renamed from the African American Institute in remembrance of his father in 1992. O’Bryant said the goal of this event was to recognize the “unsung heroes” at Northeastern. 
“It’s important for me because so many people help to make life at Northeastern easier, and they don’t always get recognized,” he said. “So, taking this opportunity to say thank you and recognize the work that they do, sometimes going unrecognized, giving them a chance to see and feel that people do appreciate what they do.”
Rodney Sadberry, a student development and outreach coordinator at the O’Bryant Institute, gave the opening remarks.

“We stand on the shoulders of giants, Martin Luther King, Malcolm and others who did a lot to bring young African American students to where they are today,” Sadberry said.
Crutchfield, whose mother is a native of Costa Rica, served in the army for seven years as a surgical technician. She then majored in criminal justice at Bay State College in Boston, and was hired by NUPD in 2008. Crutchfield worked in many positions in NUPD, but found her passion in the Crime Prevention and Community Engagement Unit, where she is involved with the community through bike registration events, “Coffee and Tea with NUPD” and other outreach events.
“I’m grateful to receive [this award],” she said. “It goes to show that even though we do things out of the kindness of our heart, we do things because it’s something that we love and have a passion for, that there are people watching, and there are people who appreciate things that we just see as us doing our job.”
Grace graduated from Fordham University in New York with a degree in political science and Spanish and attended law school at Northeastern. In her position at the Office of Institutional Diversity and Inclusion, Grace’s goal is to promote diversity, inclusion and equality at the university-wide level. 
“I am truly honored … I think everyone in the entire university can say that we never push them away into that Northeastern shuffle, and I think that’s why we’re here, so thank you,” she said during her acceptance remarks.
Araya grew up in Santiago, Chile, and spent time as a volunteer firefighter starting at the age of 16. In 2002, he moved to the United States and in 2013 he started working at Northeastern. To this day, he is an honorary member of the San Bernardo, Chile fire department. He also runs Fire Trucks Chile, a company that exports equipment and emergency vehicles to South American fire departments. 
“It’s an honor for me [to be recognized],” he said while accepting the award. “I love to work here at Northeastern. I meet different people every day here, it’s my second home.”
Raynor has worked at Northeastern for more than 15 years, and continues to have a strong passion for furthering student success. Kathy Brown, the senior director for employment and special programs and Raynor’s boss, described Raynor as a “superstar.”
“I don’t even have enough adjectives to describe her,” she said. “She’s my right hand woman, and the place would not run without her. I look forward to seeing her every day. She’s like family to me.”
In her acceptance speech, Raynor recognized her “work family” and offered a challenge to the audience.
“Thank you to my family and my work family who came here today,” she said. “Everyone is here to make something better for themselves, so keep doing that. My challenge to you is, why not make history? Why not be great? Why not think big?”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/58129/editorial/column-black-history-is-everyones-history/,Column: Black history is everyone’s history,"Brittany Mendez, news staff","February 27, 2019","At Northeastern, 6 percent of students are African American, 8 percent are Hispanic, 16 percent are Asian American and 1 percent is Native American. What do all of these groups have in common besides being minorities here? They all have heritage months. Why?
American history is notorious for neglecting the history, life stories and accomplishments of marginalized communities that helped build this country. Therefore, minorities have heritage months to celebrate their portion of history frequently left out, especially in the classroom. The College Board currently offers three Advanced Placement history exams: European history, United States history and world history. Why does European history get its own course while all others are distributed within world history?
Not only do curricula neglect non-Eurocentric content, but they also skew and misrepresent the experiences of minority communities. As Black History Month winds down, it is important to address why this month is so important – and not just to Black people.
Although Black History Month specifies Black history, it is really a month to acknowledge what should be generally seen as American history. That means not only commemorating Black people within forgotten American history, but also the white people in positions of power that perpetuate inequality. Black History Month allows white and non-Black people of color to reflect on their privilege. 
School curricula are improving, but Black history is often only taught during February. This trend gives the impression that Black history is unimportant the other 337 days of the year. As with any heritage, it is most impactful when its history is considered on a regular basis. Teaching history is crucial to how we evolve from our past, and students are more likely to recognize injustices if reminded of their origins. 
The study of slavery explains many present-day issues the United States still battles. Redlining, for example, was a discriminatory practice that allowed mortgage lenders to section off neighborhoods with red lines so they could reject housing loans to credit-worthy people. The effects of this continue to devastate Black communities today. If such history is not taught in our classrooms, how can we expect the next generation to correct the errors of the past?
More schools should adopt requirements like those within Northeastern’s history department, which require students to complete one course from the category of “History Outside the United States and Europe” to earn a history degree. If every department integrated a non-Eurocentric history requirement, students would inherently be more aware of issues within marginalized communities.
It is not Black people’s responsibility to correct their peers’ and professors’ microaggressions and at times, overt racism. We must all learn about the roles marginalized groups played in American history to promote an environment conducive to optimal learning. Black history is especially important at an institution that boasts diversity, but lacks Black students; when questions about slavery or racism arise, professors shouldn’t look to the two or three Black students in predominantly white classes. 
As a Black student at Northeastern, I rarely come across Black professors who understand my experience as a minority at a predominantly white institution. If a professor uses their position of power to reinforce the importance of Black history, not only is my college experience enriched, but so are the lives of my white peers.  
If you are white and reading this, how many times have you been the only one in your classroom? The reality is, probably never in your academic career. The uncomfortable feeling of isolation Black students feel every day could be alleviated by something as simple as seeing our history normalized. 
So, participate in Black History Month. Make an effort to learn about the true diversity within American history regularly, because that can only have positive effects on our society.
As Chimamanda Adichie says in her famous Ted Talk, “The Danger of a Single Story” – “Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize. Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that broken dignity.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/58134/editorial/op-ed-is-starving-our-teenagers-the-new-fast-track-to-health/,Op-ed: Is starving our teenagers the new fast track to health?,Kristen Kilgallen,"February 27, 2019","Although being overweight is a characteristic, not a behavior, overweight individuals are often perceived as if they have done something wrong simply for existing. Health care providers and researchers continue to blame patients for their weight, forcing internalized societal beliefs concerning the “correct” weight upon individuals. Patients face negative health effects from weight-loss methods little to no evidence supports as successful. 
The American Heart Association recommends that anywhere from 1,800 to 2,200 calories are needed daily for normal bodily functions of teenagers. But projects like Australia’s The Fast Track to Health Trial restrict participants aged 13 to 17 to 800 calories a day for a month, followed by a stage of intermittent fasting of 600 to 700 calories three days per week for the next year. 
This “war on obesity” has hijacked researchers’ objectivity and allowed scientists to fall prey to the cognitive distortion of weight standards. Our health care system is failing its patients because providers refuse to accept mounting evidence that contradicts the moral and cultural beliefs associated with being “fat” — laziness, gluttony, shame. There is little to no evidence that calorically restrictive diets are a successful tool for long-term weight loss, nor is there data to support the idea that weight loss, in isolation of other confounding factors, will lead to better health outcomes. 
Studies that showed positive health outcomes associated with weight loss focused only on short-term diets. In the Look AHEAD trial, which used lifestyle interventions to aid weight loss, two separate groups enacted the same changes in behavior, like implementing a moderate exercise routine and a more balanced diet. Regardless of whether they lost weight or not, both groups showed signs of improved quality of life and health. These results further suggest that weight loss has no bearing on whether or not one’s health improves.
The stress of being overweight in our society is traumatizing, and that mental stress manifests in the body. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention even indicated that diet, exercise and other daily activities are only a fraction of what determines our health; the largest indicator of good health is economic status. If health care providers were truly concerned about keeping people healthy, why not advocate for closing the wage gap or supporting universal health care?
Why are we subjecting kids to methods scientifically proven to cause metabolic damage, hormone imbalances, an unhealthy relationships with food and negative self-esteem? Not only is the weight loss minimal (5 percent of one’s body weight), but many subjects regain the weight within a few months, often with additional weight gain. This cycle of weight gain and loss places increased strain on the cardiovascular system and causes inflammation, a main contributor to the diseases often linked with obesity, such as diabetes and heart disease. 
We are perpetuating a cycle of malnourishment in children during the most crucial stages of their lives. The hypervigilance required to maintain a suppressed body weight impairs an individual’s ability to participate fully in life, while they perceive their body weight as a fault and obstacle they are unable to overcome. 
If overweight individuals were meant to be thin, their bodies would not fight them to get there. If their weight were truly an ailment to their health, moderate lifestyle interventions could help them to get back to their setpoint weight range without waging a war on their bodies. The pre-existing notions of weight must be challenged and changed. People take better care of their bodies when they are coming from a place of love, not from restrictions meant to beat our bodies into submission.

https://huntnewsnu.com/58106/campus/at-nu-conference-environmentalists-stress-communication/,"At NU conference, environmentalists stress communication","Isaac Stephens, news correspondent","February 27, 2019","Environmentalism can no longer just be the realm of Yellowstone rangers and marine biologists: Bethany Wiggin, a climate activist who has embraced “transdisciplinary” efforts, said at a Northeastern University climate change conference that academics and advocates concerned about the environment need to learn how to communicate with ordinary people.
Wiggin’s “Climate Change and Pedagogy” presentation was the keynote address at the Northeastern University “Climate Change/Crisis/Creativity” conference, organized by NULab. The conference, held in the Raytheon Amphitheater Friday, brought academics from a variety of disciplines together to discuss environmental issues.
Wiggin, who is the founding director of the University of Pennsylvania’s environmental humanities program, said that transdisciplinary efforts in environmentalism, exemplified by the mix of science- and humanities-oriented perspectives present in the conference’s talks, are becoming more important as environmental issues increasingly threaten to affect the general public.
“The environment is no longer ‘out there,’” Wiggin said.
To illustrate her point, she showed the audience a map of Boston’s land area in 2100 after a projected sea level rise of 10 to 12 feet. There wasn’t much left to see.
The vast majority of the people affected by the catastrophes caused by climate change would not be academics, and ordinary people aren’t likely to trust academics completely, according to the Pew Research Center.
In order to convince the general public that change is needed, environmentalists need to stop relying so much on scientific data, Wiggin said. While their efforts should still certainly be staunchly rooted in science, a more human approach to messaging, like art, might better connect with people. 
The response to Wiggin’s message, and to the conference as a whole, seemed to be positive. Shalanda Baker, a law professor at Northeastern who gave a “lightning talk” toward the beginning of the event on the social justice implications of a transition to renewable energy, said the transdisciplinary representation even among the conference’s group of speakers was inspiring. 
“We have such a great corps of people doing climate and energy work,” Baker said. 
The conference highlighted speakers from various Northeastern departments and colleges, along with a few artists unaffiliated with the university.

Outside the conference, though, not many activists are eager to pick up their paint brushes in defense of transdisciplinary environmentalism. Wiggin thinks that’s a problem.
“If we think about the environment at its most basic, there are so many ways of thinking about it that it’s strange we think about it through science exclusively,” she said.
Of course, there are concerns raised by this position. In the past, purists have been critical of any shift environmentalism makes away from deep scientific roots. This movement, however, is more an expansion of science than a deviation from it: Communication skills have power, and they can be used to magnify the impact of the scientific field, Wiggin said.
“We need to move away from the assumption that technical skills will fix this problem,” Wiggin said. “Sometimes I talk to parents who say, ‘Why is my child majoring in English? I’m so worried.’ What I always try to say is that communication skills are really valuable […] Rhetorical power is the power to touch hearts.”
She went on to discuss her own experience touching hearts for environmentalism, including her collaboration with a group she referred to as “the real EPA” — she later explained they called themselves the Environmental Performance Agency. She also described her leadership in Data Refuge, an international public archiving project she said began as fears of government data-purging intensified. These fears seemed to resonate with the audience.
Attendees came from colleges all over Massachusetts, according to NULab. For at least one, the message stuck. Kyle Peet, an environmental sustainability professor at Regis College, said that after hearing just the first half of the conference’s speakers, he had a new understanding of the environment’s relationship with ordinary people. 
“Communicating science to the masses is a fundamentally important thing,” Peet said, “but also difficult.”"

https://huntnewsnu.com/58101/sports/womens-basketball-loses-in-final-seconds-gets-swept-by-hofstra/,"Women’s basketball loses in final seconds, gets swept by Hofstra","Vincent van Oorschot, news staff","February 27, 2019","The Huskies let one of the biggest leads they’ve had this season slip through the cracks Sunday afternoon, as Hofstra snuck past Northeastern at the Cabot Center by a single point, 63-62.
Though Northeastern (15-10, 5-9 CAA) was up by thirteen going into the final quarter, a basket by Hofstra (8-18, 2-12 CAA) guard Sica Cuzic with nine minutes left in the game kick-started the biggest comeback of their season.
With three minutes to play in the game, two consecutive big-time 3-pointers by Ana Hernandez Gil put the Pride level with a Huskies outfit that had restricted Hofstra’s offense until that point.
With both teams making their free throws down the stretch, it was after Husky guard Stella Clark went one-for-two at the line that once again Cuzic found the ball with two seconds left, making the and-1 layup over Clark.
After Cuzic knocked down her free-throw to put the Pride up by one, a fumbled catch on the inbound by NU senior forward Gabby Giacone ended the game on a sour note, giving Hofstra the season sweep over Northeastern.
“We had the right shots,” head coach Kelly Cole said. “We just couldn’t get anything to fall.” 
Northeastern scored one basket in the fourth quarter.
The game started at a physical and fast with Clark knocking down a 3 to start the contest. With the Huskies starting off 5-6 from the field, they took an early lead at the first quarter break, 21-15. This was capped off by an elegant spinning layup by freshman forward Alexis Hill.
The first half was highlighted by both teams’ ability to hit the target from beyond the arc. Hofstra was 3-9 from downtown, while Northeastern held its own going 4-8. Having made those four 3s in the first half, Northeastern would not make another for the rest of the game, whereas the Pride hit four more in their dominant second half.
Two unsportsmanlike fouls were given throughout the game, highlighting just how physical this game was and how much fight both teams gave. Hofstra guard Boogie Brozoski was handed one after a flagrant foul was committed on Jess Genco two minutes into the second half. NU junior forward Ayanna Dublin was also handed an unsportsmanlike foul after she retaliated to a hard foul from forward Jaylen Hines from the Pride.
Northeastern had a very even scoring spread across the roster on the day with Dublin, Shannon Todd and Genco being the Huskies’ leading scorers. Genco went into the game tying Melissa Kowalski’s all-time career starts record with 115. She finished the contest with 14 points, knocking down one 3-pointer in the process.
Sunday’s loss leaves Northeastern with three straight losses heading into their home games against UNCW (16-10, 9-6 CAA) and the College of Charleston (7-19, 3-12 CAA) this weekend. Cole emphasized the importance of this last portion of the season heading into the CAA tournament halfway through March.
“We’ve got absolutely a favorable schedule going into it,” Cole said. “This is one we were counting on, but we got to get back on top of things.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/58097/lifestyle/trash2treasure-recycles-clothing-at-exchange/,Trash2Treasure recycles clothing at exchange,"Riana Buchman, news correspondent","February 26, 2019","Trash2Treasure members hauled overflowing suitcases to the fourth floor of Ell Hall Thursday night for the club’s first annual clothing exchange. 
Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ “Thrift Shop” played through speakers as the club set up shop for prospective clothing swappers. Participants freely roamed around the tables in search of new items. In exchange for bringing at least two of their own items, participants could take new clothes.
“Normally, all we do is the big winter clothing drive and the big spring clothing drive,” Merkle-Raymond said. “We’re trying to do smaller events throughout the semester in order to not have as large collections then and also try to minimize waste now. If some people wait all the way until then, they might be throwing things out in the middle of that.” 
Club members separated the room into different clothing sections, each with a collection of vibrantly colored tops, skirts and more. One person after another slowly filed into room 408 to survey possibilities. Some brought a couple articles of clothing, while others brought bags full for donation.
Vice President Alia Newman-Boulle, a third-year behavioral neuroscience major, emphasized that events like the clothing swap can highlight the increasing waste at Northeastern. 
“In the scope of Northeastern, the amount of clothing that has gone to landfills in recent years has been exponentially higher than it was like 10 years ago,” Newman-Boulle said. “Especially since I think a lot of people at Northeastern are very fashion-forward, I think it helps bring attention to how much clothing gets discarded and if there’s ways to recycle and reuse it.” 
Merkle-Raymond said sustainability within Northeastern is especially important given the dynamics of campus, with students often transitioning from study abroad or co-op. 
“Because people do so much at Northeastern, we have so much waste,” Merkle-Raymond said. “People continue to leave, and just having the ability to reduce that amount of waste as people leave, or have it pass it onto other people at Northeastern, is at least better than throwing those things away.” 
Third-year theatre major Emma Hunt, who heard about the event through Facebook, scavenged through the piles of clothes in search of summer wear. She also contributed to the exchange by bringing eight pieces she no longer needed.
“I’m moving off campus hopefully this summer. I just realized I have so much stuff, more stuff than I need, and I can’t bring it all with me when I go off campus,” Hunt said. 
Club members encouraged people to take whatever they liked and advertised that all leftover clothing would be donated. 
“We’ve had clothing swaps just between friend groups in the past, so I think it’s easy when you make it into a broader audience and have other people get to enjoy it,” Merkle-Raymond said. “There’s so many things people clearly have to get rid of, so I don’t see why we wouldn’t try it.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/58047/sports/muellers-four-points-help-womens-hockey-tie-merrimack/,Mueller’s four points help women’s hockey tie Merrimack,"Mike Puzzanghera, sports editor","February 23, 2019","Freshman forward Alina Mueller continued to build her case for the Patty Kazmaier Award Saturday, scoring four points on two goals and two assists as Northeastern erased three separate deficits to tie Merrimack 4-4 on the road.
The Huskies (23-5-5, 21-3-3 WHEA) travelled north to face the Warriors (16-11-7, 12-10-5 WHEA) for their final regular season game. The two teams faced off Friday night at Matthews Arena, where Northeastern shut out Merrimack, 3-0.
Saturday was a different story, as the Warriors got on the board early. Defender Felila Manu scored with a wrap-around at 1:18 to give Merrimack an early 1-0 lead.
The Huskies leveled it before the end of the period, as Mueller scored her first goal of the game on the rush. Senior forward Tori Sullivan fed her the puck while breaking toward the Merrimack goal, and Mueller fired a wrist shot from the left wing that flew past Vermont goalkeeper Samantha Ridgewell.
Northeastern took the lead at the start of the second; Sullivan scored with only 29 seconds off the clock in the frame. Mueller took a point shot that Sullivan redirected in front of Ridgewell, knocking the puck down and bouncing it past the netminder to make it 2-1.
It looked as though the Huskies would head to the locker room with the lead, but Merrimack struck back with two goals late in the period to take a 3-2 lead. First, defender Chloe Cook scored on the power play at 17:52 to tie the score before forward Katelyn Rae got a short-handed goal with just seconds left in the period. The short-handed goal was the first the Huskies have given up all season, and it sent them into the locker room down one.
Resilient as ever, NU fought back, and senior forward Kasidy Anderson tied the score once again with another redirect. Mueller was the architect again, firing another point shot that Anderson was able to flick past Ridgewell.
Merrimack took the lead yet again at 13:57, as forward Paige Voight put her 11th of the season past NU goalkeeper Aerin Frankel. For the third time, the Huskies were faced with a deficit.
It took just over a minute for NU to strike back, however, as Mueller scored her second of the game. This time, she was the one redirecting a shot, as she got a touch on junior defender Paige Capistran’s effort to put it past Ridgewell.
The two sides failed to score for the remainder of the period, sending the game into overtime.
In the extra period, Merrimack threatened often, but Frankel was at her best. She sprawled out to make a great save on Rae’s chance with less than 30 seconds remaining in the extra period, and the Huskies held on for the tie.
Despite giving up four goals, Ridgewell played well, saving 42 shots and keeping the Huskies from taking two points home with them.
Mueller’s four-point game was the first of her collegiate career, and brought her season total up to 48. After being named as one of the ten finalists for the Patty Kazmaier Award, the annual award given to the top player in women’s college hockey, Mueller scored five points across two games this weekend on three goals and two assists.
She ends the regular season as the Huskies’ top scorer, with 19 goals and 29 assists to lead the team in both categories. She also finishes the season second in the conference in both points and assists, as well as fifth in goals.
Mueller and the Huskies will be back on the ice Friday to take on Vermont (10-18-6, 8-15-4 WHEA) in the first round of the Hockey East tournament at Matthews Arena. The weekend series is best-of-three, with games scheduled for Friday, Saturday and Sunday, if necessary."
https://huntnewsnu.com/58044/sports/mens-basketball-seniors-get-well-deserved-send-off-in-win-over-towson/,Men’s basketball seniors get well-deserved send-off in win over Towson,"Seamus McAvoy, news staff","February 23, 2019","Northeastern once again appeared prone to giving up large runs, but a strong second half fended off Towson as the Huskies earned a 73-58 victory on senior day. 
Towson (10-19, 6-10 CAA) entered the afternoon just seventh in the CAA, but they’ve proven that they can give the top of the conference some trouble. The Tigers managed to take down Northeastern (18-10, 12-4 CAA) 75-72 earlier this season in Towson, and they took conference-leading Hofstra to double overtime before falling in the end 91-82 Thursday night. Their game-to-game competitiveness is largely thanks to their stout defense and rebounding — the Tigers rank first in the CAA in opponent field goal percentage (.428) as well as rebounding (37.5 per game). 
The Huskies once again got a taste of that grittiness. Sophomore forward Tomas Murphy, starting in place of junior guard Jordan Roland after a nice performance Thursday against James Madison, got things going with a contested 3 to give Northeastern an early lead that would last nearly nine minutes. Murphy continued to show off his range with a buzzer-beating three after the first media timeout, but it took some time for either team’s offense to get going. 
With junior guard Shawn Occeus still sidelined with a leg injury, junior guard Donnell Gresham Jr. once again drew the task of slowing down the opponent’s best player. This time it was guard Brian Fobbs, who is fifth in the conference in scoring with 17.9 points per game. He was held to just five points on 2-7 shooting in the first half.
Northeastern jumped out to a 26-17 advantage with under four minutes remaining after Murphy finished off an and-1 layup set up by junior guard Bolden Brace on the fastbreak, but the Tigers were anything but dismayed. Towson answered with a 10-0 run to end the half and stunned the Huskies as they took a 29-28 lead into the break despite only holding the lead for 1:16. 
“We didn’t have great offense in the first half, but we still had the lead until about four minutes left, and they came back,” Pusica said after the game. “We knew we had to bring more energy and keep guarding them, and eventually we were going to score, and that’s what happened.” 
Towson opened the second half with another layup to give them their largest lead of the game and the Huskies were clearly searching for answers. It was two steps backward for every step forward early on, as senior center Anthony Green was called for a technical after throwing down a ferocious dunk. The teams traded baskets before a 3-pointer from Gresham reclaimed the lead for Northeastern at 39-37. 
The Huskies broke off a 14-2 run capped off by a Pusica 3-pointer to take a 51-41 lead, their largest of the game to that point. Pusica knocked down another massive 3 with 2:15 remaining, giving the Huskies a 64-52 lead and sealing the victory, as Northeastern went on to get a 73-58 win. 
“I was really excited the way we played today,” head coach Bill Coen said after the game. “Obviously the outcome we were pleased with as well … the style of play that they play is very difficult to compete against.” 
In his final game at Matthews Arena, Pusica bounced back after a quiet first half to finish with 19 points on 7-13 shooting, five steals and four assists. With two more conference games and a conference tournament still ahead, the Serb knows there’s still work to be done, but took a moment to reflect on his time as a Husky. 
“My redshirt year was the hardest year, not being able to play,” said Pusica, who transferred to Northeastern after two years at the University of San Diego. “But all these guys and the guys before that were here, they helped me, they welcomed me, and it’s really felt like home these last three years.” 
Gresham and Murphy were also crucial to the second-half effort. After tallying just three points on 1-3 shooting in the first half, Gresham went on to score 16 on 6-9 shooting, including 4-7 from deep. Murphy backed up his impressive first half with an equally strong effort in the second. He tied career highs in both points and rebounds with 21 and 12 respectively, and did so with a mix of 3s, free throws, putbacks and post moves. 
Joining Pusica among those set to graduate this spring are Green and forward Jeremy Miller. Among them, the trio have played in 324 collegiate games and combined for 2,487 career points, collecting 74 victories together. 
“This group of seniors is really really special,” Coen said. “Obviously the championship year last year … but each guy has made contributions to the program. They’re all going to graduate, they’re highly respected kids on campus, and represent the program the right way.” 
With the win, Northeastern improves to 18-10 (12-4 CAA) on the season and sits at second in the conference. Towson falls to 10-19 (6-10 CAA) with the loss. The Huskies will travel to Delaware (16-12, 8-7 CAA) for their penultimate conference game."
https://huntnewsnu.com/58041/sports/storms-weathers-merrimack-attack-earns-first-career-win/,"Storms weathers Merrimack attack, earns first career win","Mike Puzzanghera, sports editor","February 22, 2019","Making her first career start on senior day, senior goaltender Brianna Storms not only got her first career win, but her first career shutout as well, making 21 saves as the Huskies blanked Merrimack 3-0 Friday.
Northeastern (23-5-4, 21-3-2 WHEA) took on the Warriors (16-11-6 12-10-4 WHEA) at Matthews Arena for the second time this season. In the first meeting, the Huskies grabbed a 6-3 win on their home ice.
Prior to the game, the Huskies honored their five seniors in a ceremony: forwards Kasidy Anderson and Tori Sullivan, goalkeepers Brittany Bugalski and Storms and defender Maddie Hartman.
In addition, they brought out a special starting lineup — in their best efforts to get all five seniors out on the ice, the Huskies started Anderson, Sullivan, Alina Mueller, Hartman, Brooke Hobson, and Storms.
The first period was marked by a quartet of NU penalties, giving Merrimack plenty of power-play opportunities including almost two minutes in a 5-on-3. But the Huskies’ penalty kill held strong, as they arguably had the best chance during the 5-on-3 with Mueller being denied on the rush.
The Huskies created plenty of chances during the period despite the infractions: Sophomore defender Skylar Fontaine had a good shot from between the circles, junior forward Matti Hartman had a few chances, including one that she mis-hit from just in front of the net and Mueller had her aforementioned short-handed chance. Despite 14 shots, they failed to find an opening goal.
Storms stopped all 11 Merrimack shots in the period while Merrimack netminder Lea-Kristine Demers made 14 first-period saves.
The second period began with an early NU goal, with sophomore forward Veronika Pettey striking less than two minutes into the frame. Pettey and freshman forward Chloe Aurard broke through on a 2-on-1, with Aurard taking a shot that was saved by Demers. However, the rebound spilled out to Pettey and despite a deflection by a Merrimack defender, the puck managed to drop down into the back of the net.
Four minutes later the Huskies scored a second, with Mueller tapping home a beautiful passing play. After receiving the puck out on the right wing, junior forward Andrea Renner played a brilliant cross through the heart of the Merrimack defense, where Mueller was waiting to slip the puck past Demers.
Northeastern spent most of the period in the offensive zone, registering 14 shots on net and getting two goals. Fewer penalties allowed the Huskies to limit Merrimack’s chances, with Storms only being forced into six saves in the period compared to 11 in the first.
The Huskies would grab their third goal and put the game to bed at the start of the third, with Renner sniping her 10th of the season. Renner took a pass from junior Codie Cross and ripped her effort top-shelf, leaving Demers with no chance.
Northeastern was able to skate through the remainder of the third period without much to worry about — Merrimack only registered four shots on target during the frame, leaving Storms without too much to do.
“I had a lot of fun out there,” Storms said. “I can’t thank Brittany enough, because she’s also a senior, and gave up her half to let me finish it. It was super special, going out on that.”
Storms finished the game with 21 saves, earning the first win of her career in her first-ever start.
“I think the score speaks for itself — she did awesome,” head coach Dave Flint said. “It was a tough decision but it wasn’t. She’s given so much to this program and meant so much to this program, and I owed it to her to play her tonight.”
With two senior goalkeepers, Flint had a gameplan set up to give both playing time Friday. But sometimes, plans need to change.
“The plan was to split with her and Bugalski, and Brit came to me after the first period and said, ‘Listen, if we’re rolling and she’s doing well, leave her in,’” Flint said. “That’s the type of captain we have. So we left her in, and she kept going, and she got the shutout.”
Storms spent most of her career as the backup to Bugalski, and when Aerin Frankel came in Storms’ junior year, she was moved further down the pecking order. Her lone appearance as a Husky before Friday came in her freshman season, when she saved six of seven shots across 27 minutes against Boston College.
“People don’t realize that’s an important position, and I don’t think in my coaching career I’ve had a better one,” Flint said of his third-string keeper.
The program will lose all five seniors at the end of the season, a season which Flint is hoping to extend for as long as possible.
“They all make me smile on a daily basis,” Flint said. “They’re a funny group, and they keep things light in the locker room. But I think missing all their contributions on the ice. They’re all important pieces of our team. Losing the five of them after this year is going to be tough, and you can’t always replace certain players, and this is going to be a tough group to replace.”
Storms technically departs as the Huskies’ all-time leader in save percentage with .964, saving 27 of the 28 shots she faced in her career, placing her ahead of Florence Schelling’s mark of .940. She has also recorded a shutout in 100% of her starts.
“I’m going to miss the camaraderie that is involved with being a team, coming to the rink every day and seeing 25 smiling faces,” Storms said. “There’s going to be a lot that I miss, but I couldn’t have asked for a better four years here.”
The Huskies head to the road to face Merrimack for their final regular season game Saturday."
https://huntnewsnu.com/58036/sports/huskies-protect-home-court-against-disruptive-dukes/,Huskies protect home court against disruptive Dukes,"Seamus McAvoy, news staff","February 21, 2019","Despite seeing its 21-point lead cut to just one, Northeastern bookended Thursday night’s action with a pair of strong runs that proved to be too much for James Madison. The Huskies walked away with a comfortable 76-60 win in their penultimate home game of the season. 
Northeastern (17-10, 11-4 CAA) doesn’t often hold the size advantage, but it did tonight, and certainly exploited that early on — Northeastern notched a trio of offensive rebounds in the same possession that somehow didn’t end in a made basket, and senior center Anthony Green drew a roar from the crowd when he finished off a missed layup from senior guard Vasa Pusica. 
Things got even worse for James Madison (12-16 5-10 CAA) when forward Dwight Wilson, who leads the team with 7.8 rebounds per game, was forced to sit after picking up two personal fouls in less than three minutes. This opened up the paint for Northeastern on a night when the 3-pointers weren’t falling at their usual rate — the Huskies only managed to connect on two of seven attempts from deep in the first half against the second-best 3-point defense in the conference. 
Head coach Bill Coen likely couldn’t have asked for a better start on the defensive side of the ball. Junior guard Donnell Gresham Jr. drew the task of slowing down guard Stuckey Mosley, James Madison’s leading scorer and fifth-highest scorer in the CAA with 17.6, and managed to hold him to just two points on 1-7 shooting in the first half. 
It was a similar story for the rest of the Dukes early on. At one point they trailed Northeastern by 18 before picking up just their second field goal of the night with 10:17 left in the first half. 
The tide turned shortly after NU senior guard Vasa Pusica picked up back-to-back fouls on the same defensive possession and went to the bench. The Huskies’ offense grinded to a halt and gave James Madison a window to get back into the game after a dreadful start. The Dukes broke off an 8-0 run with Pusica on the bench, prompting the Serb’s risky re-entry with 8:10 remaining. It was a scrappy end to the half, but Northeastern maintained a 33-26 advantage at the break despite a poor shooting from beyond the arc. 
“I think [James Madison] has got really good size and length on the perimeter,” Coen said after the game. “But I also thought [Jordan Roland] missed some open 3s that he normally makes, he’s a rhythm guy. [Bolden Brace] had a couple that he normally makes, but we’re good shooters.” 
The start of the second half gave the Huskies the same scares that ended the first. Missed opportunities off of turnovers and offensive rebounds haunted the Huskies, and their lead was cut to just 37-36 after Wilson got a layup and free throw to go. After switching to a bigger lineup, however, Northeastern found some success continuing to attack the paint. Sophomore forward Tomas Murphy found Green after a nice drive and dump-off pass to set up an easy dunk, and Green got another layup to go despite a foul to give the Huskies a 46-38 lead with 11:46 left. 
“It’s definitely a change-up that I think is good for when we need to go big in there,” Green said of his partnership with Murphy, who added 12 points on 5-10 shooting.
Back-to-back 3s from Gresham and Brace gave Northeastern some breathing room, and a layup from Murphy on the fastbreak gave the Huskies a 57-42 advantage with 8:00 to go. After warding off James Madison’s formidable push earlier in the second half, the game never looked close again, and the Huskies were able to coast to a comfortable 76-60 victory. 
Green picked up his third double-double of the season (and his second in three games) in what was an all-around performance — he ended the night with 17 points on 7-8 shooting, plus 3-5 from the free throw line, and added 11 rebounds. 
“[Pusica] and [Roland] were just finding me at the right time and we figured out kind of how [James Madison] were going to play, so I was in the right place at the right time,” Green said. 
Pusica led the team in scoring once again, racking up 19 on an efficient 7-13 shooting to go with seven assists. Junior guards Gresham and Roland both added eight points on 3-7 and 3-9 shooting respectively. 
In conference news, Northeastern will enjoy a small cushion in second place ahead of the College of Charleston, who lost this evening to William & Mary, 86-84. An impressive performance from Towson took first-place Hofstra to double overtime, but fell in the end 91-82, allowing Hofstra to virtually clinch the top seed in the tournament. 
With the win, Northeastern moves to 17-10 (11-4 CAA) on the season and sits tight at second in the conference. James Madison falls to 12-16 (5-10 CAA) with the loss. The Huskies will take on Towson Saturday at Matthews Arena for the final home game of the season."

That does not come without a price.
The price of an increasingly fast-paced news cycle is that insensitivity regularly makes it past editors, whether due to a rush to publish or a lack of journalists with diverse perspectives who can evaluate stories for such errors.
Furthermore, young journalists in the making, like myself, are not taught how to address insensitivity constructively or incorporate a method into our writing process to catch these errors.
In smaller publications, insensitivity is as glaring as this (since-deleted) headline The Mercury News shared in 2016 following an American win at the Olympics: “Michael Phelps shares historic night with African-American.” You may know this African-American as Simone Manuel.
Additionally, in a time when condemning racial rhetoric should be just as important as reporting it, the media has stepped back rather than confront it head-on. For example, sometimes it’s what isn’t said that is just as insensitive as what is. 
When Steve King received backlash for his comments defending white supremacy in this New York Times article, NPR simply called his string of remarks over 16 years in Congress “racially charged.” In fact, “racist” appeared only twice in the article — both times in different quotes. In the wake of the blackface scandal in Virginia, the New York Times equated “dark makeup” to the blackface Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring also admitted to wearing. 
Distasteful, controversial, culturally insensitive — these are words that dance around calling out racism for what it is, words that shield white journalists from the power racism carries.
The fact of the matter is that American news media does not reflect the diversity of the nation, and it struggles to reverse the historical erasure of a wide range of voices. 
Newsrooms are good at writing stories about the lack of diversity within their own newsrooms or the need for it across the country. Yet, they are just as good at maintaining that lack of diversity and doing little to address the need for it. Even efforts to address this fault reflect the struggle for diversity in newsrooms across the nation.
The best example was pointed out by Liz Spayd, a public editor at the New York Times. In “Preaching the Gospel of Diversity, but Not Following It,” she criticized the hypocrisy of her employer for criticizing the lack of diversity in the newly-elected president’s cabinet when the more than 20 reporters tasked with covering his presidential campaign had even less diversity, including only two black reporters and no Latino or Asian reporters.
Fast forward more than two years to when CBS announced the reporters chosen to cover the 2020 presidential election. Of the eight reporters, not one was black and more than half were male — garnering a backlash on Twitter CBS seemed shocked to receive. Will we ever learn?
The American Society of News Editors has a yearly Newsroom Employment Diversity Survey. In 2018, the survey found the average publication staff was 59 percent male. Over the course of 17 years, newsrooms increased gender and racial diversity only a little more than 30 percent — meaning newsrooms today still consist of more than 50 percent white and male reporters.
Despite a small rise in diversity over the course of a decade, there is a quote by Cindy Hook, an American businesswoman, I find particularly fitting: “Diversity without inclusion is simply a number.”
With these facts and statistics come mistakes, inevitable when majority-white newsrooms tackle issues they cannot empathize or relate to. White and male journalists don’t know what it’s like to have what journalism professors call “skin in the game” when it comes to issues of race, gender and sexuality.
The difference is clear to journalists who understand this disparity. Earlier this month, April Ryan, a successful journalist and author, bureau chief for American Urban Radio Networks in Washington, D.C. and CNN political analyst, came to Northeastern. I rushed straight from my morning classes to hear her speak and have her sign my book. I nearly stumbled over my words as I introduced myself, praised her book and told her how her career inspired me. 
She gave me specific suggestions to expand my palette of knowledge and encouraged me with advice from one journalist to another. Just before I turned and left, she said, “And always make your voice heard.”
I am discouraged by the fundamental flaws in the lack of diversity and growing insensitivity in the profession I’ve chosen to pursue, but I am a fierce believer in accountability. 
Regardless of whether I’m the only Latina or black woman in the room or not, I will take Ryan’s advice to heart for all the women of color revolutionizing journalism as I strive to enter the field; for the Ida B. Wellses and Cecilia Alvears no longer with us, for the Andrea González-Ramírezes, Maria Hinojosas and Ilia Calderóns, for all the Jenna Worthams, Tanzina Vegas and Errin Haines Whacks of today.
Like them, in this high-speed world where journalism must operate to record history the second it happens, I will make my voice heard. As for the institution of the press I hold so dear, do better — the world is watching."

They competed alongside Northeastern’s Distilled Harmony, which placed third, and other college groups. 
“Going in we were pretty confident,” said Distilled Harmony member Greg Myren. “I feel that we had a tough time in the venue, and we made a few mistakes.” 
Myren, a first-year, praised Pitch, Please! for their performance. 
“We are so proud of them. They absolutely killed it, ” Myren said.
Berklee’s own Upper Structure emceed the event, which nearly 900 people attended.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology group Syncopasian was the first troupe introduced to the stage,  incorporating R&B and pop multilingual songs. Olin College of Engineering’s group the PowerChords told a story of jealousy and heartbreak during their set with a rendition of Duffy’s “Warwick Avenue” and Céline Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On.” The Chorallaries from MIT engaged the crowd with their cover of Panic! At The Disco’s “Say Amen (Saturday Night).” 
Pitch, Please! began their set next, and both their choreography and vocals showed intricate attention to detail during their solos and throughout their set.  
Berklee’s On The Vox tried to keep the energy going with their set, closing the first half of the competition with Oh Wonder’s “Technicolour Beat.” Emmanuel College’s all-female group, For Good Measure, performed after intermission with a cover of Estelle’s “Conqueror,” opting for simple choreography and focusing on vocals. 
Distilled Harmony kicked off their set with Shawn Mendes’ “In My Blood” and kept high intensity throughout with great choreography and solos.
Berklee’s all-male group, the CharlieChords, then took the stage and showed off their choreography skills during their cover of Imagine Dragons’ “Whatever It Takes.” 
Bentley University’s Off The Clock finished the competition with a performance that transitioned from slow gospel music to a fast-paced finish. 
Upper Structure entertained the crowd as the judges tallied scores, filling the time with covers from their previous performances. 
The judges gave special awards to individual singers, with Pitch, Please! members third-year Lora Riehl and second-year Mackenzie Hunt winning best vocal percussion and best solo performance respectively. Pitch, Please! was then announced as the winning group of the second quarterfinals. They will be moving onto the Northeast semifinals, along with the second-place team, the CharlieChords. 
Olivia Triplett, the third-year leader of Pitch, Please!, commented on their group’s efforts. 
“We’ve been rehearsing every day, and I think that we have something special that we need to share with everyone,” Triplett said. “The set this year is so much more special to us and well thought out in a way that we think people will enjoy more than any other before.”
Jessica Muhlenberg, mother of Pitch, Please! soloist second-year Julia Muhlenberg, praised her daughter and the group for their performance and hard work. 
“I am extremely proud of her and the rest of them, and I am so excited to see how far they can go,” Muhlenberg said.
Pitch, Please! came in third place in the first ICCA quarterfinals last year and could not move onto the semifinals. 
“We have so many supporters coming for us now,” Triplett said. “I just know that I’d be happy as long as I walk off stage knowing that I did the best that I could have done in that moment.”"

https://huntnewsnu.com/58000/lifestyle/review-spamilton-an-american-parody/,Review: ‘Spamilton: An American Parody’,"Samantha Barry, news staff","February 20, 2019","How does a Needham-raised playwright, actor and director manage to create a show that not only spoofs the mega-hit “Hamilton” but also the entire Broadway industry itself? 
The answer is simple. Gerard Alessandrini’s musical, “Spamilton: An American Parody,” combines the fast-paced nature of the original show with comedic writing and a trove of hidden musical references to deliver an event sure to excite the theatre kid inside us all.
Alessandrini wrote and directed the show, which will play at the Calderwood Pavilion at the Boston Center for the Arts through April 7. It opened in New York in 2016 and began a national tour since last January. 
The plot of “Spamilton” essentially revolves around “Hamilton” creator Lin-Manuel Miranda’s quest to save Broadway. Sick of the same old show tunes, Miranda’s character in “Spamilton” starts a rap revolution and is determined to “not let Broadway rot.” 
Alessandrini cleverly weaves this narrative through parodies of Miranda’s original award-winning songs — with the “Broadway rot” line being a riff on “My Shot” from “Hamilton.” This witty wordplay continues throughout the musical. Some highlights from this songwriting technique include switching “You’ll Be Back” to “Straight is Back” where King George steps out to state that introducing rap into Broadway will, unfortunately, make it significantly less gay. 
Another favorite is “What Did You Miss?” taking inspiration from the opening song of the second act of“Hamilton”, “What’d I Miss?” In the original, Thomas Jefferson returns to the United States and needs to be caught up on everything that happened while he was abroad. In “Spamilton,” the song pokes fun at one of the original’s biggest critiques: being too fast and having too many phrases for “any man to understand.”
The closing song of “Hamilton” also gets a moment to shine in its parody going from “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story” to “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Cries.” The original is quite the tear-jerker, so it is fitting that the show exaggerates just how ridiculously sad of an ending it has. 
Arguably one of the funniest moments also comes during this song. Eliza, played by Ani Djirdjirian, sings about all the things she’s done since Hamilton’s death. Just as she reaches the part about establishing the first private orphanage in New York City, who walks in from stage right? None other than Little Orphan Annie. 
“Spamilton” is filled with Broadway allusions like this. There are jokes about famed musical composer Stephen Sondheim and cameos by Broadway legends such as Bernadette Peters, Barbra Streisand and Liza Minnelli. The show even parodies several other numbers from different musicals like “The King and I,” “The Book of Mormon,” “Chicago” and “Into the Woods.” 
That said, you don’t have to get all the references to truly appreciate the show. Being a die-hard Broadway fanatic may grant you a few extra laughs, but there’s enough ragging on the industry as a whole to thoroughly entertain any musical newbie. 
It can be argued that you don’t even really need to see (or hear) “Hamilton” to enjoy the performance either. The cast, led by Adrian Lopez playing the bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Miranda, are all incredible and more than capable of performing in the original musical. Djirdjirian, the only female member, stood out among the rest for her powerhouse vocals and hilarious Liza Minnelli impression. 
Perhaps the best thing about “Spamilton,” though, is that it’s not just a funnier version of “Hamilton.” It never feels like it is trying to be something it is not. Instead, it’s a surprisingly fun spin on a show that revolutionized the industry in more ways than one."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57978/city-pulse/allston-in-2019-from-rock-city-to-college-neighborhood/,Allston in 2019: From ‘Rock City’ to college neighborhood,"Ava Sasani, news correspondent","February 20, 2019","The exterior of Great Scott could most generously be described as understated. Allston’s favorite 240-person music venue does not have a marquee. There is no fluorescent sign inviting patrons in; the only thing that distinguishes Great Scott from the banks and Thai restaurants that line the rest of Commonwealth Avenue is a faded green awning over the building’s entrance.
But step inside and patrons are transported into a carefully crafted haven of alternative and indie rock music. The nightly concert crowd files in around 8 p.m., bringing a mix of loyal Allston music junkies and increasingly, out-of-towners who have traveled to the neighborhood to see a show at Great Scott. The intimate rock hall gained mainstream fame in 2016, when the national music website Consequence of Sound ranked it as the eighth-best concert hall in America. 
Since 1996, Tim Philbin has managed both Great Scott and O’Brien’s Pub, a nearby bar and music venue. Philbin attributes Great Scott’s rising success to the hard work and precision of his staff.
“It’s a combination of our location, staff and attention to booking … even the music that’s played in between bands isn’t an accident, everything is very intentional,” Philbin said. “We have some of the best sound engineers in the city.”
By local estimation, Great Scott and O’Brien’s Pub are some of the last remaining music venues in Allston that provide high-quality performance opportunities for area musicians. Allston, affectionately dubbed “Rock City” by locals, rose to prominence as the heart of  Boston’s rock scene between the 1960s and 1980s when a growing community of young artists was drawn to the neighborhood’s rock halls and affordable rent. Now-famous acts like Aerosmith got their start in Commonwealth Avenue apartments, and many of these bands returned to Allston venues even after gaining national recognition.
Photo courtesy Great Scott AllstonFor more than two decades, Great Scott has been a staple in Allston. The venue was ranked the eighth-best concert hall in America by Consequence of Sound in 2016.
“Artists tend to be working class individuals so they tend to flock to affordable neighborhoods,” said Emma Walters, executive director of Allston Village Main Streets, an organization that connects Allston’s small business community to technical resources offered by the city of Boston. 
Walters, an eight-year resident of Allston and a graduate of Boston University, said that Allston’s “Rock City” identity, driven by an increasingly young student population, is anchored in the Allston community by venues like  Great Scott and O’Brien’s Pub. 
“You see a lot of bands who are graduating from basement shows because O’Briens is really accessible and affordable,” Walters said. “Like any neighborhood, though, there’s a real shift in the people who are able to live here.”
Allston, like almost every other neighborhood in Boston, has felt the pressures of  gentrification and displacement. In 2016, Allston-Brighton rent increased by eight percent, said Ishay Grinberg, president of the website RentalBeast. Rising rent costs have begun to impact Allston’s identity as a working class artist’s home, and it’s shifting who can and cannot play the neighborhood’s music venues.
Just a few blocks down from Great Scott, Annabelle Lord-Patey works as a ticket-taker for a larger concert venue, Brighton Music Hall. Lord-Patey, a third-year music therapy major at Lesley University, just renewed her lease on her Allston apartment. She hopes rent remains reasonable in her post-graduation years; the aspiring singer-songwriter wants to start a band with her neighbors.
“I’m hoping to stick around here … I think one day I’ll end up somewhere warmer, but Allston is cool as hell,” Lord-Patey said. “I don’t have any interest in moving to Brighton, everything’s here in [Allston].”
Drawn to Allston for the same affordable rent and musical community that drew in artists in the 1960s, Lord-Patey said that access to “Rock City”’s stages has changed since Aerosmith’s beginnings. 
“[Great Scott] puts on a lot of good, local shows, and that’s the one local place left that does.” Lord-Patey said. “Gentrification is real, small clubs are closing down, it’s mostly big stuff like [Brighton Music Hall].”
For 40 years during the height of Allston’s “Rock City” era, the building now known as Brighton Music Hall was an intimate, 340-person venue called Harper’s Ferry. Like any good indie hotspot, Harper’s Ferry featured a list of now-famous acts before they gained full national recognition. Maroon 5, Dropkick Murphys and Fall Out Boy all stopped by Harper’s Ferry during its tenure as Allston’s rock mainstage. 
But in October 2010, Harper’s Ferry’s management unexpectedly announced that the beloved music hall would be closing down because John Corey, the property’s landlord, decided not to renew the lease. 
Just two weeks after Corey announced Harper’s Ferry’s closure, the building was bought by three co-owners of Paradise Rock Club, a nearby music hall on the border of Allston and Boston University’s West Campus. One of these owners is Don Law, the president of Live Nation New England and co-owner of Boston Opera House and the Orpheum Theatre. In January 2011, Law and his colleagues reopened the Harper’s Ferry building as “Brighton Music Hall,” hoping to rebrand the venue as a destination for the more famous acts usually booked by Paradise Rock Club. 
Today, Brighton Music Hall has the same red-and-black exterior as its predecessor, but the venue feels inaccessible for young music students like Lord-Patey. 
“You’re lucky to get a gig in a place like this because it’s all touring bands,” Lord-Patey said. “Now we get a lot of bands from far away, not a lot of local bands.” 
For an older generation of residents, the loss of Allston’s “Rock City” identity is not something to grieve. Charlie Vasiliades, vice president of the Brighton-Allston Historical Society, said college residential development, not Allston’s rock halls, have been the driving force behind the “Rock City” community. The 1960s birth of Allston’s “Rock City” moniker coincided with the beginning of Boston College and Boston University’s encroachment on Allston and Brighton’s land. 
“A college population and a near-college-age population creates a fertile ground for groups being created in people’s basements, that’s a place where musicians live,” Vasiliades said. “But “Rock City” is not relevant to those of us who are not young and not part of that scene.”
Chris Triunfo Li Saumet of Bomba Estéreo performs at Great Scott.
For Vasiliades and many of the longtime residents of Brighton and Allston, Allston’s increasingly young population make for poor neighbors. The students and 20-somethings that make up most of the community seem transient, and Vasiliades said young people don’t stay in Allston long enough to care about it.
“[Brighton-Allston] went from people who called it home to people who were just passing through,” Vasiliades said. “There’s very little sympathy for the “Rock City” crowd being displaced because that crowd did the same in the 1960s and 1970s.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57876/editorial/column-black-history-isnt-ancient-history/,Column: Black history isn’t ancient history,"Brittany Mendez, news staff","February 20, 2019","“Dear Students, they didn’t steal slaves. They stole scientists, doctors, architects, teachers, entrepreneurs, astronomers, fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, etc., and made them slaves. Sincerely, your ancestors.” 
Mississippi middle school teacher Jovan Bradshaw decorated her classroom door with these words in honor of Black History Month. Photos of it soon went viral. Bradshaw reminds us that these are not just stories about nameless slaves and prominent Black figures, rather they are the lives of people who were just as human as you and me.
Carter G. Woodson started the first annual Negro History Week in 1926. He was the son of two slaves, and later earned a doctorate at Harvard University and became a renowned author, historian and journalist. Negro History Week occurred during the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of Abraham Lincoln on the 12th and Frederick Douglass on the 14th. The holiday was extended to a full month in 1976, not because it is the shortest month of the year, but to celebrate the bicentennial of the establishment of the week-long event.
Both of my parents were already born by 1976, meaning that during a significant portion of my grandparents’ lifetime, there was no Black History Month. Many monumental strides in Black history have only occurred in the last century, which is not that long within the scope of American history. 
American schools were desegregated in 1954. Legal barriers prohibited Black citizens from voting until the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Interracial marriage wasn’t legalized nationwide until 1967. Black people were legally denied jobs and housing until the Fair Housing Act of 1968. 
But with these strides, we also struggle.
School curriculum often romanticizes the few stories of Black history taught, thus making them more easily forgotten. For example, the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, a slave owned by Jefferson, is often portrayed as a “love story,” when there was no evidence she could refuse his advances. This inaccurate representation makes the story more removed from the harsh reality of their relationship, in which Hemings was most likely sexually abused by Jefferson.
This notion that Black history is “ancient history” persists because of the dehumanization of slave stories and the perception that the United States became “post-racial” following the civil rights movement and the election of a Black president. However, much of this history occurred in our grandparents’, parents’ and even our lifetimes. Our history classes make the lives of Black figures into fairytales of the past rather than true stories of real people who endured pain, suffering and sometimes even death. 
These stories are still happening today. In the 1990s, 145 Black churches were set on fire throughout the South. Every U.S. president was white until 2008. White supremacists marched in our nation’s capital in 2018. Flint Hill, a predominantly black neighborhood in Michigan, still doesn’t have safe drinking water in 2019.
Just a few months ago, a white student called the police on a Black Yale graduate student taking a nap in a communal lounge. Imagine working your entire life to attend one of the most prestigious colleges in the United States only to have authorities invalidate your presence at the institution. Imagine the humiliation of knowing your classmates don’t believe you belong there. These are realities Black people face daily, which is why Black History Month is necessary to raise awareness of such injustices. 
This year, we celebrate the 43rd Black History Month. Though the holiday existed for most of our lifetimes, that is not the case for many of our living relatives. It is not only important to remember, it is important to commemorate its existence and ensure future generations not only look back on the Black history of trials and tribulations, but also the potential those successes and hardships give us to continue blazing ahead. 
After all, Black history is not ancient history — it is history still in the making."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57929/sports/anderson-leads-the-way-for-trophy-hunting-huskies/,Anderson leads the way for trophy-hunting Huskies,"Mike Puzzanghera, sports editor","February 20, 2019","Northeastern women’s hockey is going through a renaissance of sorts: They have made the NCAA Tournament twice in the past four years, and look primed to qualify this year. Senior forward Kasidy Anderson has played on all of these teams, and the goal-hungry left-winger has developed into a major threat in front of the net in her final season.
“The support of my teammates and my coaches and putting me in a different role than I’ve been in the past years has helped me come out every game and try to help lead the team in production,” Anderson said.
In the 2015-16 season, Anderson scored seven goals and nine assists for 16 points as a freshman as the Huskies made their first-ever NCAA Tournament appearance.
Her role as a junior in the 2017-18 season was more defined. She finished the year with 27 points on 12 goals and 15 assists. Anderson was third on the team in points, and set a new career high with her assist and point totals (she scored 14 goals in her sophomore year). The team won the Hockey East tournament and made the NCAAs.
Now, Anderson leads the team in goals with a career-high 17 with games still to play. She has also racked up 13 assists for a total of 30 points, which is tied for second on the team.
Albert TamuraAnderson prepares for a face off against BU’s Jesse Compher in a game Feb. 5.
Head coach Dave Flint named Anderson an alternate captain for this season, allowing her to help lead and teach the younger players on the team.
“She’s stepped up for us on the ice, and she’s serious when she needs to be and funny when she needs to be to loosen the team up,” Flint said. “She’s taken another step forward this year, and been a great leader for us.”
Her new role allows her to receive plenty of passes in front of the net from her linemates, putting her in a position where she can shoot immediately. Her linemates this year are freshmen Alina Mueller and Chloe Aurard. The two have provided the team with 70 points combined. Mueller or Aurard have assisted all but five of Anderson’s 17 goals. 
“Obviously my linemates make it easy for me, getting me the puck and just being able to take a shot makes it easy to finish the play,” Anderson said. “They both have incredible hockey I.Q. and they’re both very quick with and without the puck. Other than working hard, I don’t really have to do much more.”
Anderson scored her 50th career goal Feb. 8 against Merrimack, redirecting a shot from Aurard right in front of the net. The goal was originally credited to Aurard, but after looking over the replays, officials determined that Anderson got the final touch.
“The goal itself wasn’t ideal, it wasn’t very clear that I touched it … Initially it didn’t cross my head that it was my 50th goal, and then I got on the bench and everyone started high-fiving me and telling me ‘Good job!’” Anderson said. “I’ve worked hard to do that, so being able to accomplish it is amazing.”
Anderson is tied for the conference lead in goals scored while leading (10), and she is tied for fourth in the conference with 14 goals scored in wins. She has also scored 13 of her 17 goals in either the second or third period. The forward has clearly been helpful in finishing off opponents by adding late goals.
“I think I’m a very situational person, so when the pressure’s on whether we’re down or whether we’re up, I think I take that as a positive energy and I think it improves my play,” Anderson said. “So when we are up I think all the confidence is there and I’m in the right spot at the right time and I’m able to put it away.”
Brian BaeAnderson celebrates after one of her two goals in a game against Clarkson Jan. 6 in Belfast, Northern Ireland.
The Huskies’ effectiveness on the power play has been a key part of their success this year. Their first power-play unit is only slightly different from their first line at even strength: Anderson, Mueller, Aurard, Veronika Pettey and Brooke Hobson. They roll with a four-forward line to utilize their best scorers. Anderson herself has scored three times on the power play, plus an assist.
“Obviously playing with my linemates every single game, every single shift, obviously makes it easier to go out on the power play and not really have to change much other than Alina being up on the point,” Anderson said. “We all complement each other very well and obviously its showing on the stat sheet. [Pettey]’s always in the right spot and I have a pretty easy job of just standing in front.”
Flint created the line to try to maximize their efficiency when playing a man up, and it has worked well so far. The unit has scored 15 of the Huskies’ 21 power-play goals on the season.
“I’m a fan of power plays where you run four forwards, one D, and we just started messing around with some stuff,” Flint said. “You try to get as many goal-scorers as you can onto the unit. We’ve changed what we’ve been doing a little bit, but they’ve had some success and we’re kind of rolling with it.”
The team clinched the Hockey East regular season title Feb. 16 with a 3-1 win over Providence, marking only the second time in program history that they have done so. The first regular-season Hockey East championship came in 2002.
“It’s awesome to work hard all season and finally see it show in a trophy, even though we haven’t seen the trophy,” Anderson said. “I think the fact that it’s the second time in team history, I don’t think that’s going to hit us until later on when they win the 10th or 11th and we’re looking back at it saying ‘Hey, we were the second team to do that.’ It’d be nice if we were the first, but the fact that we’ve won it in [our] history, that’s awesome too.”
They clinched the title with three games still to play in the regular season, capping off a remarkable run that saw them win two of three games against Boston College, beat Boston University twice and tie them once and win two of three against Providence during conference play. Those three teams make up the rest of the current top four in Hockey East.
“Especially in a league like Hockey East where it’s competitive top to bottom, for us to win the regular season championship, it’s quite an accomplishment for the girls, and we were definitely excited about it,” Flint said.
Muhammad ElarbiAnderson makes a move to get past a defender in a game against Providence Feb. 17.
When comparing the past NCAA-Tournament teams to this year’s squad, it is evident that the Huskies are in a better position to make the tournament than ever before. Despite having a worse record at this point in the season compared to the 2015-16 team (22-5-4 vs. 25-6-1), they find themselves ranked No. 3 in the country, and No. 4 in the Pairwise, both of which put them in a solid position for the NCAA tournament should they lose in the Hockey East tournament.
“I think this year we’ve put ourselves in a position where we’ve kind of taken pressure off ourselves,” Anderson said. “Obviously we want to win Hockey East and we have a great chance of winning it, but if things don’t fall our way, we’ve put ourselves in a good position to make NCAAs, and I don’t think we’ve had that position except for my freshman year, but that was even on edge.”
Numbers aside, Anderson has an idea of which of the teams she’s been a part of is the best..
“I would say this year’s probably been the best, and it’s honestly such a great group of girls to do it with,” Anderson said."

The Huskies are set to say goodbye to another influential leader at this season’s end as Jess Genco graduates. 
The 5-foot-5 guard is not an imposing presence on the basketball court, but her style of play is anything but invisible. Her vision on the hardwood is almost unparalleled in the CAA, her shooting is a level above any of those who came before her at Northeastern and her leadership was felt by not only her fellow teammates, but also those who came to Cabot Center see her.
Genco enters her last four games of CAA play with two significant records under her belt . It was on Jan. 4 that the guard broke Northeastern’s all-time 3-point record. After knocking down her second triple of the game against Elon, she passed Melissa Kowalski’s record of 245 made 3s. Genco is sitting on 276 going into Friday’s game against Hofstra.
She dished out her 466th career assist on Feb. 1 against Charleston, breaking Tesha Tinsley’s career record.
Genco has always been a silent leader, in that she has never held her individual accolades in high regard.
“I don’t really pursue the records, they just kinda happen,” Genco said. “It’ll be a nice thing to look back on when I’m older, but right now it doesn’t really hold that much weight to me.”

A fond memory of Genco’s was back in her freshman year when the Huskies did not have an exceptional record, but managed to string together a six-game win streak at the end of the season. 
“I think that memory was a turning point for the team as a whole at that end of that season and moving into the next and it helped start the process of where we are today,” Genco said.
Genco, who is originally from Scranton, Pennsylvania, is the daughter of Catherine and Gerard Genco, who played basketball at Fordham University and the University of Scranton, respectively in their collegiate years, but they never directly pushed Genco or her siblings towards basketball. 
“My parents did a good job of letting us choose our own favorite sport, and mine just happened to be basketball which I’m sure they liked,” Genco said laughingly. “All of my siblings play basketball, but for instance my little sister does gymnastics which is her thing. 
“But basketball is the glue that really ties the family together.”
Genco, a business major at Northeastern, has led with her actions throughout her Husky career. She has always been a leader by example, and her influence has helped new Huskies contribute to the team.
“On the team she’s definitely had the biggest impact to me,” freshman guard Katie May said of Genco. “Coming in and playing right away can be a really nerve-wracking thing but she was always there and as a guard she’s taught me a lot and we’ve become really good friends.” 
May said that as a result of the friendship she has built with Genco off the court, her game has improved on the court.
Genco’s achievements throughout her time at Northeastern are extensive. Her freshman year in 2015-16 was headlined by three CAA Rookie of the Week awards, capped off by her All-Rookie First-Team nomination. Her sophomore year was committed more to her development as an all-around guard. She averaged a whopping 37.6 minutes per game, leading the team in that category while also averaging 4.1 assists per game. In Genco’s junior year she came into the spotlight, earning a nomination to the All-CAA First Team while averaging 14.8 points per game. 
When it came to Genco’s senior year in 2018-19, she wasted no time in pushing her team for success after being given the leadership role in her final year. The team  broke Northeastern’s record for the best season start to the season, opening 9-0. In the midst of this run was a matchup with Providence on Dec. 15, when Genco drained a new program record for most 3-pointers made in a game with nine. Her senior season is filled with highs. Genco is averaging 37.7 minutes per game while racking up 16.5 points per game, 4.3 assists and 4.3 rebounds while shooting 41.9 percent from the field.
Riley RobinsonGenco looks to make a move past a defender in a game against Delaware Jan. 20.
The goal for Genco has always been to make the elusive NCAA Tournament in March. Northeastern women’s basketball has made it to the tournament once before, back in 1999, but this Northeastern team is one of the top mid-major offensive powerhouses in the nation, having made the mid-major top-25 rankings on numerous occasions throughout the season.
“We’re gonna miss her work ethic when she leaves, and how much of a team-player she actually is,” said head coach Kelly Cole. “She’s always the first one in and the last one out, and every second she’s on that court fighting to win, she’s giving it 110 percent.” 
When Cole first saw Genco play she had no idea what kind of a player she would turn out to be, but looking back on the career Genco has made for herself at Northeastern, there will be a significant shift to the team when she moves on.
The Huskies have positioned themselves on a 15-9 record at this stage in the season, going 5-8 in the CAA, but Genco and the Northeastern team behind her will look for nothing less than the CAA title in Delaware come March 13."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57956/sports/nu-ultimate-grows-with-spirit-on-the-field-and-community-off-of-it/,NU ultimate grows with ‘spirit’ on the field,"Joe Lantow, news correspondent","February 20, 2019","At first glance, ultimate Frisbee seems like any other sport. Two teams of seven players line up on a field, each intending to score a point by getting the ball, or in this case, the disc, into the other team’s end zone. But look closely at any match, and it’s clear ultimate is missing a key component that is a staple of almost every other sport: a referee. 
“Ultimate is traditionally self-officiating,” said Jorden van Emmerik, a fourth-year civil engineering student and president of the Northeastern men’s ultimate Frisbee team. “Players instead call fouls according to the Spirit of the Game.”
The Spirit of the Game is an instantiated rule that guides players to follow sportsmanship and fair play in place of a referee. 
Northeastern’s ultimate program has grown since its start in 1998. In 2019, the men’s team has roughly 110 members across A, B and C teams, and the women’s team has around 80 members across A and B teams.
Alex MelagranoNortheastern’s ultimate teams occasionally practice on the newly-renovated Carter athletic fields on Columbus Avenue.
Ultimate has traditionally refrained from outside officials. Even at its most competitive collegiate levels, the closest ultimate comes to referees are “observers” who only interfere when teams can’t agree on something.
“People always look at me weird when I say ultimate is self-officiating,” said Daniel Bowler, a fourth-year and member of the men’s C team. “I always ask: How many other sports games have you seen ruined by bad refs? They break up the game.” 
While most collegiate sports programs have long-standing traditions dating back at least a century, even the oldest ultimate teams were founded in the early 1970s. Northeastern’s fast-growing team is even younger, its inception so recent (1998) that many players on the team are actually older than the team itself. 
As the game evolves, some think it might be necessary to shed the loose rules of the 70s. 
“Sports will always need referees,” said Patrick Gannon, a fifth-year and C team captain. “Everyone adheres to the spirit of the game 99 percent of the time, but there always will be that one guy who is non-cooperative. We try to control ourselves, but it’s hard to be impartial in do-or-die situations.”
In many sports, referees act to temper aggressive and highly competitive players by implementing penalties and even by ejecting them entirely from the game. Without referees, enforcing behavior sometimes becomes more difficult. Many ultimate players report no such issues, though.
“I’ve encountered two of those [non-cooperative] people in five years,” Bowler said. “It’s such a cohesive culture; your own team won’t support you if you break the Spirit of the Game.”

Anna Cullen, a fourth-year and president of the Northeastern women’s ultimate team, said she hopes the sport can keep what she views as the game’s unique spark while keeping competitive play fair. 
“This way works. Even with observers, at the end of the day, it’s still players making calls,” Cullen said. “One of the big things about ultimate is that it’s self-officiated — Spirit of the Game is encouraging people to do their best and play fair without outside people.”
In the end, players agree on one thing: It wouldn’t be ultimate without the supportive and tight-knit community. 
“Community is a big thing,” Gannon said. “No sports have felt as inclusive to me as ultimate. Everyone is so friendly and inviting.”
Ultimate Frisbee seems like a sport designed for college athletics. It’s relatively safe and easy to pick up, has varying levels of competition and needs a community to thrive. 
“We have a team for everyone,” van Emmerik said proudly. “Three men’s teams with a C team for everyone.”
It’s not just Northeastern’s team that’s growing — according to USA Ultimate, the sport’s governing body in the United States, ultimate has roots in every state.
“There really is a great community anywhere you go, with smart, kind and genuine people,” Cullen said. “It’s a really welcoming and socially conscious community.”
This welcoming community has resulted in a happy problem for Northeastern Ultimate —  an excess of players. 
 “Six to seven years ago, we only had a couple subs, and now we almost have too many people,” Bowler said.  “Most sports are learned young, but I find that many ultimate players actually come to it when they are older.”
Of course, growth comes with its own challenges for club organizers and captains. 
“It’s been insane,” Gannon said. “The size of the [men’s] program when we first split to [have a] C team is the size of C team now. We can’t continue this growth. We have to do something …  We just had 40 people sign up for a tournament with 20 slots.” 
The women’s team has also been experiencing growth, but at a slower rate, so they only have an A and a B team. 
Verda Bursal, a third-year member of the women’s B team, said that often men see ultimate as a culture first, while newcoming women tend to see it primarily as a sport. She would like to see women’s ultimate perceived more as a community and a culture in the future.
“We need more exposure for women, not just as a sport, but as a culture,” Bursal said.
Riley RobinsonMia Randolph, left, blocks Maura Radigan during B team practice drills Tuesday, February 19, 2019 in the Carter bubble.
The women’s team has some high aspirations for the future of the club in both regional and national competition.
“Our goal is that we go to nationals this year,  so we are really putting the pressure on to practice and getting those workouts,” Cullen said. “We have a great team, and every single player can play.” 
Ultimate’s fun culture, rapid growth, and focus on sportsmanship might make some think that the sport is less intense than others. But van Emmerik said nothing could be further from the truth. 
“I want people to know the amount of effort and leadership our teams have put in. People think ultimate is easy —  A team has practice and workouts six to seven days a week,” van Emmerik said. ”We are getting better every year and are on the trajectory to make it to nationals.”

https://huntnewsnu.com/57971/city-pulse/lightview-towers-over-roxbury-bringing-mixed-reactions/,"LightView towers over Roxbury, bringing mixed reactions","Laura Rodriguez, news correspondent","February 20, 2019","Northeastern University is among the first to start Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh’s “Housing A Changing City: Boston 2030” initiative with the recent construction of LightView, a new residence hall near campus. The high-rise housing development, built in partnership with American Campus Communities (ACC), will open its doors to students in August 2019. 
The new building will house 825 students adjacent to campus at Columbus Avenue and Burke Street, near the newly-renovated Carter athletic fields. The project comes at a time when many students have expressed concern with the on-campus housing supply and quality. At the topping-off ceremony, Northeastern President Joseph E. Aoun and Walsh commended the teams that helped create what they called a win-win for students and the Roxbury community.
“This is where students are going to find the supports and the amenities they need to live and thrive,” Walsh said. “What’s even more important, it’s where the people of tomorrow, the jobs of tomorrow are going to be filled. With engineers and artists, policymakers that make the kind of community that we have here in Boston a great community and a great college town.”
A Northeastern University press release referred to the partnership between the private sector and the city of Boston as an example of “Northeastern’s commitment to reinvigorating Columbus Avenue through investments, redevelopment projects, and public-private partnerships.”
Some believe that the rising cost of rent in the Roxbury community and lower income areas surrounding Northeastern’s campus is attributed to the expansion and presence of private institutions such as the universities that spread across Boston. 
“As a young girl, I felt welcome and safe,” said Amanda Govan, 25, a Roxbury resident and member of the community advocate group Reclaim Roxbury. “Now I see my home surrounded by these huge buildings I and most of the people I know aren’t even allowed to be in. And to add on to that, we’re all paying more to live here. Those aren’t isolated events.” 
The housing project, which borders the Roxbury community on the south side of campus, garnered a positive reaction from some community members, such as Jolene Goode, 39.
“I think it is a positive thing for the city, just seeing new buildings and stuff like that I feel like it should make everybody else want to be more on like a positive type of note,” Goode said. “Seeing new buildings getting built and new businesses also opening up for people to be able to get more jobs and maybe to be able to live in one of these nice buildings in the community.”
Other Roxbury residents such as Moises Rosario, a high school student, also see good in city-wide housing developments. 
“I think it definitely changes the community, but I think it changes it in a good way,” Rosario said. “I think that when you build those buildings and all of that, it’s just more fun, it just makes the community more lit.” 
Some members, like Goode, see these new developments as a driver for a shift in renting practices and community culture. 
“It’s really sad for a lot of the young ones that are trying to be on their own and get nice apartments, it’s kind of hard for them too,” Goode said. “But like I said, there’s jobs available for everybody in the end and there’s always something affordable where you can live at.”
Govan has come to Northeastern to discuss gentrification various times. Most recently, she talked about generational security, or the idea that someone can pass their property onto their children. As neighborhoods are gentrified, she said, people can lose their property and the ability to pass it onto the next generation.
“I can’t help but feel uneasy because generational security is something I cannot give [my children]. We are too often prejudged or disregarded. I would be devastated if I couldn’t live here,” Govan said. 
The cost of gentrification is visible in many college towns, but the issue is more complex than hiked-up rent prices due to the expansion of private institutions.
At the LightView topping-off ceremony, Walsh thanked Northeastern for a $153.4 million investment in quality student housing. He said that whether or not students can be housed by the university, they will still need a place to live in Boston.
Walsh, the city of Boston and the ACC say that increasing the number of on-campus housing developments will diminish the number of students renting in surrounding neighborhoods and taking homes off the market. 
Northeastern third-year Cole Adler said the solution to this problem is multifaceted.
“I definitely feel like Northeastern is a big gentrifier in Boston and very deliberately seem to be building barriers between the school and Roxbury and encroaching more and more into that neighborhood,” Adler said. “At the same time, I’ve heard multiple students complain about not being able to get on-campus housing after sophomore year so there’s kind of two sides to it.”
Hailey ArdizzoneLightView, built in partnership with American Campus Communities (ACC), will open its doors to students in August 2019.
The issue then becomes about the scarcity of viable housing options that community members have in their own communities after students move into surrounding neighborhoods. 
“Rent has gotten so expensive on the hill that most working-class families probably couldn’t afford to live there anymore,” Adler said, “My three-bedroom basement apartment is $3,000 a month all together. That doesn’t seem realistic for most families.”
And it isn’t realistic for most. According to the Boston Planning and Development Agency, the median household income in Roxbury in 2015 was $25,937, lower than Boston’s median household income of $55,777.  
This does not account for what the Boston Globe Spotlight team reported in their 2017 series on racism in Boston. A 2015 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and a Duke University researcher outlined that home equity and other assets — minus mortgages and other debts — gave white families a median net worth of $247,500 compared to the $8 figure for African-American, non-immigrant households. 
“I feel as though, everywhere is about money,” Goode said about rising rent costs. “Boston is full of money and businesses, so, you know more money, more business, bigger buildings, more people, more money.” 
Walsh said the partnership between Northeastern and the city of Boston is meant to alleviate the pressures of having a large institution encroach on pre-existing communities. 
“825 new beds will help alleviate pressures in areas like Roxbury, Mission Hill, Fenway and the South End,” Walsh said. “It’s going to open up more units for other families to be able to stay in those neighborhoods, and this is a great example of using scarce urban land to build more efficient housing for our students.” 
Other city officials are skeptical of the projects eventual impact. Boston City Councilor Kim Janey, who represents Roxbury, has led a series of forums on gentrification in Roxbury during her time in office. She told The News that the city must do more to ensure “development without displacement.”
“I’m not sure how LightView would alleviate anything,” Janey said. “We didn’t get here by accident. This city’s discriminatory housing policies have allowed developments like [LightView] to happen. [The policies] block black people out from legitimate home ownership opportunities … it’s a crisis.”

https://huntnewsnu.com/57880/editorial/column-homelessness-is-a-circumstance-not-a-trait/,"Column: Homelessness is a circumstance, not a trait","Matt Hersey, columnist","February 20, 2019","Last night, snow illuminated the streets of Northeastern’s campus as I wandered home from a friend’s West Village apartment to my warm room overlooking the beaming city.
Yet, throughout Boston, forgotten residents fell asleep cold and wet. The snow is only beautiful if you have a retreat from it. 
Despite ongoing efforts by Mayor Martin J. Walsh to quell the growing population of people experiencing homelessness in Massachusetts, that population rose 14 percent from 2017 to 2018.
The Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless estimated in January 2018 that 20,068 people in the state experience homelessness, the majority being families with children. In a state of almost 7 million, this figure may seem insignificant. But the shocking growth rate should spark alarm. 
You would expect that in reaction to these stark numbers, the Massachusetts Legislature would prioritize funds to confront this growing problem. Most bills being currently proposed by the Legislature provide promises toward greater assistance for individuals experiencing homelessness. They fail to address the causes of the problem, namely rising rent costs and gentrification.
This is not to say that our elected officials don’t care about the homeless. But it seems most people would rather push the conversation past homelessness to the next topic. 
Homelessness is often considered characteristic. We would rather believe people who live on the periphery of our society are deficient or disadvantaged in some way, mentally or physically. This could not be further from the truth. 
Homelessness is most commonly transitional or situational, not chronic. In fact, of the 20,068 people in Massachusetts who experience homelessness, only 2,122 people experience chronic homelessness.
Chronic homelessness is a term used to describe individuals who experience homelessness for at least a year, or repeatedly throughout their lives. These individuals are not homeless due to lack of character or bad decision-making, but often because they live with a mental illness or addiction. Forgotten on the street is the last place they need to be.
Legislation seems to ignore homelessness for two reasons. First, lawmakers and the general public overlook homelessness because individuals who experience homelessness are too easily misconstrued as being lazy and undeserving people, rather than equals who need support and love.
Secondly, homelessness is largely overlooked due to economic or personal finances. People think with their wallets and tend to speak with them as well. Bills that fund community health or community housing raise taxes on individuals who, for the most part, have not experienced homelessness. It is understandable why someone would not want the money they earned taken from them, but if paying taxes means living in a better society, we shouldn’t be afraid of raising them.
No one deserves to sleep outside in the snow, especially not those who need care and attention. Shelters help people transition out of homelessness, but for those individuals who experience chronic homelessness, shelters are a Band-Aid. 
We need to recognize homelessness. We need to recognize that people who experience homelessness are not “the homeless.” They are individuals with stories and lives of their own, each with something special to offer.
Wandering home, padding through snow back to a warm room is a privilege we should all experience. The joy of returning to a place you call home isn’t a privilege; it is something everyone deserves, not just those who can afford it."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57959/city-pulse/warren-weld-and-moulton-massachusetts-role-in-the-2020-election/,"Warren, Weld and Moulton: Massachusetts’ role in the 2020 election","Paige Stern, news correspondent","February 20, 2019","As the 2020 presidential election nears, the Democratic primary field is growing larger by the week, with more than 10 candidates already in the running. Massachusetts often has a reputation for offering presidential candidates, and 2020 is no exception. 
Former Gov. Michael Dukakis said Massachusetts’ role in the upcoming election will likely be no different than in elections from the past.
“Massachusetts seems to supply more candidates for the presidency than any other state in the country, and this year is no exception,” said Dukakis, who is now a political science professor at Northeastern. “It will also be providing hundreds of volunteers and thousands of dollars for Democratic candidates.”
Currently, there is one Massachusetts Democrat officially running for the 2020 election: Sen. Elizabeth Warren. 
The two-term senator from Cambridge announced the launch of an exploratory committee on New Year’s Eve, making her one of the first public officials to formally consider a run at the Oval Office.  Less than two months later, on Feb. 9, she officially launched her campaign at a rally in Lawrence, where she spent a lot of time last year following the Columbia Gas explosions. 
Since then, Warren has spent time in Iowa to get a head start for the caucuses that are just under a year away. Though there are several candidates currently running around Iowa trying to find support, it’s hard to forecast anything at this point, Dukakis said.
“Nobody is ahead or behind in Iowa at this stage,” said Dukakis, who was the Democratic nominee for the 1988 presidential election and lost to George H. W. Bush. “Most polls are much too premature and reflect recognition more than anything else at this point.” 
Having run a presidential campaign of his own, Dukakis can say from personal experience what it means to be running before the election has truly begun. 
“When I started, I don’t think I even registered a point in the Iowa polls,” he said. “On caucus day I was one of three leading candidates there and ultimately won the nomination and beat Bush one in Iowa by ten points.” Bush, however, won the election with a sweeping 426-111 electoral college vote.
Warren is campaigning against corporate power and government corruption. In several interviews and speeches, the senator has conveyed the public’s lack of trust in the current administration, and described how corporate America has thrived as its leaders pocket profits while leaving scraps for the lower-middle class. 
When she spoke at the National Press Club in August 2018, Warren opened her speech with the polling question, “Do you trust the federal government to do the right thing all of the time, or at least most of the time?” Warren then informed her audience that in 1958, the 73 percent of Americans answered “yes” was, and that number dropped to 18 percent  in 2018. 
True to form, in the fall of 2018, Warren introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act. The policy would ban past presidents, vice presidents, federal judges, members of congress and cabinet secretaries from lobbying, and require presidential candidates to provide at least the last eight years of their tax returns. The policy aims to restrict the influence of financial interests in federal lawmaking. The act has been referred to the Committee of Finance and awaits further movement in a Republican-controlled Senate. 
Warren’s current stance on foreign policy includes bringing home troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, while cutting the defense budget to invest in diplomacy. She also seeks criminal justice reform and the decriminalization of marijuana, as well as gun law reform and abortion rights. She has said that if they pay taxes, undocumented immigrants should have access to government-subsidized healthcare. 
However, despite her ambitious campaign, Warren has continued to face the same obstacle she faced back when she ran for Senate in 2012.
In 1989, Warren changed her ethnicity from Caucasian to Native American on a University of Pennsylvania School of Law payroll form. She claimed to be a distant descendant of the Cherokee and Delaware Tribes. Thirty years later, these claims continue to follow Warren throughout her political accession.
Warren has expressed to the press that her matriarch family members revealed her roots to Native American tribes in the 1980s as this generation of her family were aging and dying. 
Many aggressive responses to Warren’s statements are based on the idea that she may have achieved as many influential roles as she did, including teaching jobs at Penn and Harvard University, thanks in part to her claims of Native American ancestry. However, investigative reporters from the Boston Globe, after conducting “more than 100 interviews with her colleagues and every person who had a role in hiring” Warren, clarified that she was viewed as a white woman in the processes. 
After she took a DNA test to confirm her heritage, many Native American leaders argued that since tribes have their own regulations of citizenship it cannot be up to a DNA test to decide what it means to be Native American. 
Northeastern political science professor William Mayer said this issue could hurt her electoral chances.
“She does have some baggage,” Mayer said. “I think the whole way she has dealt with her purported Native American heritage will hurt her. Many Democrats will feel that she’s a risky candidate to nominate for the general elections. But it’s hard to say at this point how far that sentiment will go.” 
Two other Massachusetts politicians are considering joining the race: former Gov. William F. Weld and Rep. Seth Moulton.
Chris TriunfoSeth Moulton, who represents Massachusetts’ sixth congressional district, addresses a crowd of constituents in Salem.
Weld announced Feb. 15 that he is organizing an exploratory committee to potentially seek the Republican nomination for the presidency. The first Republican to announce a campaign against Trump, the 73-year-old is considered a moderate member of the party who previously ran for vice president as a Libertarian alongside former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson in the 2016 election. 
As for sixth-district Rep. Moulton, all that is known about his potential campaign is that he is looking into it. 
“I’m thinking about running for president … I’m going to take a very hard look at it,” Moulton said in an interview with Buzzfeed News. 
Dukakis, on one hand, “[doesn’t] think Seth will be a candidate,” while Mayer said that he could run, but that “he has no chance,” and doesn’t know what he’s thinking. 
“Members of the House of Representatives almost never do well in presidential nomination races,” Mayer said.
It’s too soon to tell where Massachusetts will stand this upcoming election. With Bernie Sanders’ recent entrance into the race, the 2020 Democratic nomination seems open to any candidate.
“We are going to have a lot of candidates,” Dukakis said. “The Iowa caucuses are a year away. The political landscape out there will look a lot different than it does now.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57946/front-1/students-housed-on-commonwealth-ave-troubled-by-lack-of-communication-and-security/,Students housed on Commonwealth Ave. troubled by lack of communication and security,"Avery Bleichfeld, news staff","February 20, 2019","Maddie Campbell, a second-year mechanical engineering major, wanted to live with her friend so much that she agreed to move two miles off campus to Northeastern’s housing at 1110 Commonwealth Ave. By the summer, however, she was having second thoughts.
“We called housing numerous times, both of us on the phone with the people, and we were like, ‘We really don’t think this is a good idea,’” Campbell said. “We just came back from N.U.in the year before and we really want to be on campus.’”
The housing office replied that if they wanted to live together, that was their only option. For Campbell, it was the beginning of a semester of lacking support from the housing office and issues that went beyond just the building’s distance from campus.
Campbell and her roommate Taraneh Azar, a second-year journalism and political science double major, said they were let down by poor communication about the size and cost of the apartment. The apartment was smaller than Azar and Campbell anticipated, and while the distant apartment was advertised as a way to save money, it was only slightly cheaper than other on-campus housing options, Azar said.
“A lot of things [about the residence at Commonwealth Avenue] were exaggerated or not made as clear as I think my roommate and I wished they would have been made,” Azar said.
One of the biggest issues for Azar was that the building is not owned by Northeastern, but by an outside housing management company called Alpha Management. This kept the university out of the loop when issues arose and made the chain of command “really hard to follow.” She said she worried that the school would dismiss an issue if she brought it to them.
The school maintains that students should speak to the Housing and Residential Life staff and facilities in order to fix maintenance issues, despite the outside ownership. 
The situation left Azar and Campbell feeling powerless. Once, in the middle of the day, they received an email notification that someone was coming to check on their plumbing and was going to enter their room whether they were there or not. 
Worried about their valuables and the idea of having strangers in their apartment, Campbell left in the middle of her class to make the half-hour commute back to the apartment.
“It ruined my entire day because I was so concerned about what was going on in my housing life that I didn’t have the opportunity to continue the rest of the day with my classes,” Campbell said.
Campbell was also disappointed by the residence’s general security, which she said was “not even present.” Azar said that the proctors there didn’t follow the same precautions as the ones in other residence halls.
“I would have friends who show up right in the lobby, right before the door that you need a key to enter the actual building, and they’d text me, ‘Hey, can you come down and key me in’ and then a minute later I’d get a text, ‘Oh, nevermind, they let me in. I’m on your floor,’” Azar said.
When they tried to address their concerns, Azar, Campbell and other students found few avenues to pursue the problems.
Campbell said that when a friend’s package went missing they went to the residence director to see if they could access the security camera footage to see what happened. The RD told them that the only way for Northeastern personnel to access the footage was if the Northeastern University Police Department opened a case. Campbell said the response was “extremely unsettling.”
Azar said she felt the cameras were part of a larger security system that seemed like it was more for appearances than anything else.
“There were a lot of precautions in place that seemed like they would keep students safe that in reality were just more show than anything,” Azar said. “Those cameras put a lot of other students’ minds at ease until we were told that the footage really was held by nobody that we could get in contact with.” 
When Campbell reached out to her RA and RD about security concerns, she was told, “Well, there’s nothing we can do.”
Students at 1110 Commonwealth Ave. aren’t the only ones facing challenges with housing. In January, the ceiling of an apartment at 110 St. Stephen St. collapsed and a burst pipe in International Village caused flooding. For transfer students like Holly Christensen, a third-year computer science and design major, on-campus housing wasn’t even an option.
Christensen said that when she first applied, the housing office initially said that it was unlikely she would get on-campus housing. The school later notified her that she, and all the other transfer students, wouldn’t be offered housing at all, which Christensen said was frustrating.
Jessamyn Ingram, a second-year environmental engineering major and transfer student, said the school told her from the start that she would not be offered housing. It left her feeling unsure about her situation.
“I guess [I felt] a little bit disappointed, … but I knew that I wanted to go here and so I was like, ‘I’m going to figure it out,’” Ingram said.
Though Northeastern did not offer on-campus housing, Ingram said the school did provide support in helping her find another place to live. There is a website to help transfer students find roommates and offers potential apartment listings, though Ingram said most were out of date.
Ingram was also given an opportunity to attend workshops and seminars on finding off-campus housing, and the Off-campus Housing Service read students’ leases to make sure they weren’t getting cheated by landlords or signing a bad lease.
Campbell also found some measure of support. When Azar left for a co-op in New York, Campbell got the chance to move to a residence on St. Stephen Street.
“I was able to go to the housing office and talk to somebody about it face-to-face and for once they actually made the process fairly simple,” Campbell said. “But it seems like the housing process at this school is not simple at all.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57945/lifestyle/ikemba-africa-night-fosters-unity-on-campus/,Ikemba Africa Night fosters togetherness,"Nia Beckett, lifestyle editor","February 20, 2019","A range of artists represented Africa and its diaspora in Blackman Auditorium on Saturday night at the Northeastern African Student Organization’s, or NASO’s, Ikemba Africa Night 2019. Ikemba is an Igbo word meaning “strength of the people.” 
Ghanaian entertainer Ebaby Kobby hosted the event, providing comedy surrounding African culture while giving information on each participating group.
“Our show is centered on bringing people out from all over Africa diaspora together through music, art, dance and fashion,” Kobby said.
First-year chemical engineering and biochemistry combined major Elizabeth Kokoti Madison modeled for fashion brands MIZIZI, Boak and Ataria NYC during the show. Coming from a high school with a less prominent African community, she appreciated Northeastern’s support.
“This is very new to me to be in this type of community, so it was really nice that they did this,” Kokoti Madison said. “It was really cool to rep my continent [and] country.”
Several of Africa Night’s performances highlighted talents across college campuses. Second-year biology major Ajoa Addae, known as AJ to friends and fans of her poetry, performed one of her poems that “tells the truth about [her] African diaspora identity,” Addae said. Penn State seniors and aspiring producers Toyin Ores and Lamii performed several songs, combining hip-hop and afro influences. NASO dancers and Brandeis University’s Platinum Step Team displayed cultural pride through movement.
Kobby conducted a roll call during one transition, welcoming the audience to respond as he named countries and regions. He found that attendees represented a range of countries across Africa and its diaspora, with a large number responding for Nigeria and Ghana.
Six women and five men took the stage for a best-dressed contest at the conclusion of the night. The audience cheered to cast their vote for a winner, who received six yards of traditional printed cloth as a prize.
Contest winner Ayomide Balepo flew from Pittsburgh to attend the event in support of her friend, NASO cultural liaison Kamnsi Arachie.
“It was very interesting to see the fashion lines and the dances and the poetry,” Balepo said.
NASO president Rasheed Adenlola wasn’t surprised by the distance some audience members traveled. Many NASO members have contacts with neighboring schools’ African student organizations and come from different regions, Adenlola said.
“Africa Night has been something that’s been very prominent at Northeastern for a good amount of time,” Adenlola said. “I think people expect good things from us.”
The program of this year’s event, which Adenlola said sold out a week ahead, was different than planned. NASO originally secured Nigerian singer Burna Boy as the closing act of the show. Thursday night, Adenlola received an email saying Burna Boy was sick and would no longer be attending the event. The NASO board held an emergency meeting to secure a new act, which ultimately failed due to the short notice.
After the Northeastern Ticket Office sent out an email informing ticket holders of Burna Boy’s cancelation, approximately 100 ticket holders requested refunds, Adenlola said.
“I didn’t really know about Burna Boy before, and all my friends had canceled their tickets,” said second-year sociology major Anneke Gustafson. “I felt bad, so I went because I thought no one else would.”
Despite the incident, NASO “bounced back” and presented an enjoyable show, Gustafson said.
“It shows that they have support and solidarity outside of having a big act,” Gustafson said."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57940/campus/ken-henderson-named-first-chancellor-of-nu/,Ken Henderson named first chancellor of NU,"Deanna Schwartz, news staff","February 20, 2019","On Feb. 11, Northeastern announced the appointment of former College of Science Dean Ken Henderson to the position of chancellor. The newly created position encompasses the management of student affairs and enrollment, as well as undergraduate, digital, lifelong, experiential and graduate learning. Henderson began his role on the day of the announcement.
While Henderson declined to be interviewed for this story, he told News @ Northeastern that “as Chancellor of Northeastern University and senior vice president for learning, I look after all aspects of that learning ecosystem. It is a holistic role that fulfills the strategic plan for learners as it is laid out in Northeastern 2025. The strategy is to look at learners even before they are enrolling at the university, all the way up to lifelong learners in the workplace.”
Northeastern 2025 is the plan to expand NU into a “networked university, one that empowers humans to be agile learners, thinkers and creators, beyond the capacity of any machine,” according to the Northeastern 2025 Academic Plan.
Henderson is the second academic to take on a senior leadership role at NU, along with Provost James C. Bean. Henderson’s role may have been created to as the Vice President and Chief Executive Officer of Lifelong Learning, Philomena Mantella, will leave NU to be president of Grand Valley State University on July 1.
“President Aoun is laser focused on achieving the goals set in our academic plan, Northeastern 2025,” said Renata Nyul, the vice president of communications at NU, in a Feb. 12 email to The News. “This includes expanding Northeastern’s global university system to Europe and beyond, elevating our research enterprise, and extending our leadership in experiential learning. No university has the momentum that Northeastern has today. President Aoun sees the remarkable accomplishments of the past 12 years as a foundation for building even greater success in the years to come.”
The new administrative setup with Henderson as chancellor is similar to the one at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT. This arose at the Feb. 13 Faculty Senate meeting, with Susan Powers-Lee assuring the faculty present that NU is in no way copying MIT’s administrative plan. Powers-Lee is a faculty member in the College of Science who ran the meeting in Provost Bean’s absence. 
While Northeastern Admissions boasts having students from “a myriad of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds” in its student body, the administration itself has been criticized in the past for lacking diversity. Some students, especially those of marginalized backgrounds, feel as if they are not represented. 
“They love to emphasize the global experience and diversity, but they don’t practice what they preach,” said Dieynaba Dieng, a Senegalese first-year political science and international affairs major.
Kat McElderry, a first-year bioengineering major, said that she does not think the administration is very representative of the community. 
“It feels as if our concerns aren’t represented as well,” she said."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57877/editorial/op-ed-can-any-film-topple-roma-for-best-picture/,Op-ed: Can any film topple “Roma” for Best Picture?,Lal Birali,"February 20, 2019","The Oscars are reaching a slow but inevitable demise. Viewership declines every year. This year, the show struggles to maintain legitimacy after losing Kevin Hart as a host due to the revelation of past homophobic comments as well as awarding several nominations to films with problematic racial implications  (like “Green Book”) and directors facing #MeToo allegations – “Bohemian Rhapsody.” 
However, we still watch the awards show every year in anticipation of the final award. We hope the Academy will finally reward a film not only narratively and technically brilliant, but culturally significant. Instead, we see the self-indulgent voting body rewarding feel-good stories assuaging white guilt (see “Driving Miss Daisy,” “Crash” and this year’s “Green Book”) or homages about Hollywood (“Chicago,” “Argo” and “Birdman”). 
Only recently do we see film dichotomies favor small-budget, critical darlings over beloved box-office hits. In 2010, “Avatar” lost to “The Hurt Locker” and in 2017, “Moonlight” edged out “La La Land.” But every year we expect the Academy to improve, it regresses, as was the case when a pedantic, forgettable “The Artist” won in 2011 and a simplistic movie centered around bestiality, “The Shape of Water,” won last year. 
What will the Academy choose this year? The traditionalist “Old Hollywood” voter bloc has its conduits in the feel-good film “Green Book” and the clichéd, tragic rise and fall of two celebrities in “A Star is Born.” The newer, diversified voting members may favor the multi-layered subtle politics of “Black Panther” or the unflinching parallelism of the KKK rhetoric to the current administration in “BlacKkKlansman.” 
However, the film that has won the most critical awards in the Oscars run-up is the Netflix triumph “Roma” directed by Oscar winner Alfonso Cuarón. 
On the surface, it is the perfect film to blend the two voting blocs together. “Roma” centers around a housekeeper for a wealthy family during times of civil unrest in Mexico. The film is technically brilliant, shot in black and white, and possesses poignant, well-acted emotional scenes. Cuarón found the recipe to reach all members of the voting body with this combination of factors, in addition to focusing on a young female protagonist. 
But therein lies my frustration with “Roma.” It ticked just enough boxes for liberal film critics and traditionalist, older members, seemingly avoiding any major criticism. The film also ends with a rather simplistic viewpoint of class tensions, with everyone embracing on the beach as if to say: “As long as we love each other despite suffering, we will triumph together.” Yet, the film ends as it begins — with the protagonist still a domestic worker. 
Films with two main characters of different socioeconomic statuses tend to find one thing they can bond over that glosses over real issues at hand. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali bond over anti-racism in “Green Book” without any real depth or nuance. This alone makes “Green Book” problematic, in addition to the controversy surrounding director Peter Farrelly’s misconduct on past movie sets.
Hollywood continues to move toward showcasing stories with non-traditional protagonists. This year showed some of this shift with talented ensembles in “The Favourite,” “Black Panther” and “BlacKkKlansman.”  
Ironically, between the black star power in both “Black Panther” and “BlacKkKlansman,” I’d prefer the snubbed “If Beale Street Could Talk” as the best expression of black love and determination. Despite the historical significance of “Black Panther,” I didn’t find it the most exciting Marvel film in 2018. Though the parallelisms highlighted in Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman” are alarming and poignant, the Academy didn’t reward his magnum opus, “Do The Right Thing.”
The fairy-tale ending is consistently rewarded in Hollywood. This is probably why “A Star is Born” will not win Best Picture, even though it lived up to the hype. 
The fate of Cooper’s Jackson Maine was predetermined, but the eventual suicide is still almost too much to bear. Although the film doesn’t end right after, the defeated look on his face is the film’s last impression. The ending is too depressing. This same issue plagued “Manchester by the Sea,” “Up in the Air” and “Brokeback Mountain.” 
However, at the of the day, the Oscars are predictably unpredictable. We observe larger trends over years, but the year-to-year vacillation makes each year uniquely exciting. I want to say the Academy will award Best Picture to the quirky “The Favourite,” the culturally significant “Black Panther” or the classic love story of “A Star is Born.” But since I am a betting man, I believe the Academy will go with “Roma.”

This year and last year, the event has been split between two days, one for undergraduate students and the other for graduate students, on Thursday and Friday respectively. On both days, the Cabot Cage filled with company representatives from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. These events were open to all majors, although students needed to pre-register online a week earlier in order to get in the door.
Career fairs are nothing new to Northeastern, as the all-major career fair is a semesterly event. Similar events in previous years drew lines of students that stretched all the way past the steps of Snell Library. On Thursday, however, students had ample room to talk to more than 100 prospective employers at booths organized into a grid inside the indoor athletic facility. 
Hailian Jiang graduated from Northeastern in December 2018 and went “trying to find some opportunities” after graduation.
Bradley FargoHailian Jiang, a Northeastern alum, attended the career fair to try to find professional opportunities in post-graduation life.
This wasn’t her first time at one of these events, having participated in the co-op program at Northeastern. She has been to the career fair every year since she started at Northeastern, and said “the last few years there are less people” because of how the event was split into two days.
She previously went on co-op at Mentor Graphics, an electronic design automation company. While there, she went as a prospective employer to a career fair with Worcester Polytechnic Institute students. She mentioned she had seen their resumes.
“Northeastern students have more formal resumes compared to other students. Advisors help us,” Jiang said. “We have the co-op program. Co-op advisors help us to format the resume and also communicate [with employers].”
Bryant Grey-Stewart, a fifth-year mechanical engineering major, attended the fair as he prepares to finish college.
“It’s honestly just a good opportunity,” Grey-Stewart said. “It’s a chance to talk face-to-face with the people you’d be actually working with. Something you can’t get online.”
Bradley FargoBryant Grey-Stewart finds the career fair to be a good place to connect with potential employers in person, rather than through a resume.
Originally, he wanted to go into aerospace. Right now, he’s looking for something electro-mechanical, robotics-oriented, ideally in Massachusetts.
“The co-op is great. Really helps you figure if you actually have any idea of what you want to do,” Grey-Stewart said. “Sometimes you think you know what you want to do. Then you do it, and your opinion changes.”
He said he had a great time chatting with the people at various booths, mentioning Boston Engineering for their friendliness. His latest co-op was at iRobot working as a robotics engineering intern. This spring marks his final semester at Northeastern; he will graduate in May.
“Where I ended up is not anticipated, but it’s a good place,” Grey-Stewart said about leaving NU.
Matt Schroeter is a second-year bioengineering major. He noticed that many potential employers are open to candidates studying various engineering majors, regardless of concentration.
Bradley FargoMatt Schroeter spent his time at the career fair at the booth for Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc., a company that creates ground-penetrating radar systems.
“You put a lot of pressure to choose the right major [on yourself],” Schroeter said. “I’ve been talking to these engineering companies and they’re saying a lot of the skills you learn in any engineering major are transferable.”
Among other engineering companies, Schroeter talked with representatives from Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc., a company that creates ground-penetrating radar systems.
“If you’re designing a biomedical device it’s the same as designing ground-penetrating radar,” Schroeter said. “The design skills are the same.”
A few of the tables featured signs mostly in Chinese, one of them for the Overseas Students Services Corporation, a multinational corporation that employs around 300 people in the United States and many more in China.
Bradley FargoSimon Chen tabled for Minty Mentors and the career fair.
Minty Mentors is the education and tutoring branch of Overseas Students Services Corporation. Simon Chen, who was tabling for Minty Mentors, said that by halfway through the day they had talked to about 20 students and were expecting more.
“We have many employees from Northeastern,” Chen said. “Last year we also attended the career fair. We got five students to become our employees. That’s great. We are expanding our business; we need more talent, especially from local Boston.”
Conrad Welzel, a project manager for public works and transportation in the city of Portland, Maine, said he talked to around 15 students by noon. The city tabled for three civil engineering positions, a transportation engineer, a surveyor and a co-op to be involved in the Geographic Information System data collection process. Most of the people who came by the booth weren’t studying civil engineering.
Bradley FargoConrad Welzel, a project manager for public works and transportation in the city of Portland, Maine, shows a map to career fair attendees.
“We had a great experience last year with a student. He got to [do a project]: Park Avenue,” said Welzel. “He created a whole new bike path, he worked in taking a street and realigning the parking spaces and where the bike path was going to be so it functioned in a new role.”
This was Welzel’s first time at the fair. The co-op student the city employed the previous year worked with Jennifer Ladd, a senior transportation engineer for the public works department in Portland.
Ladd said it was worth noting that a parking-separated bike lane is “a little bit more involved” than a normal bike lane. It “required a lot of coordination with the public” because the street is heavily used by automobile traffic and has street parking.
“One of the things we will be focusing a lot this summer on is the design and reconstruction of [pedestrian] ramps to comply with federal ADA guidelines,” Ladd said.
Bradley FargoJennifer Ladd works closely with co-op students during her job for the public works and transportation department in Portland.
The Americans with Disabilities Act is a piece of federal regulation that has been around since the 1990s and was most recently amended in 2008, but many nearby towns and cities are “feeling the pressure to meet these guidelines” after “someone … came with a magnifying glass and evaluated Boston,” Ladd said. One of the co-op positions would be helping to design some of those pedestrian ramps.
Meltwater, a company with eight offices in the United States and Canada, was another prospective employer. They are also working with Northeastern, providing services in the field of online media monitoring, also known as media intelligence.
Bradley FargoRyan Reeves is the director of people and talent for Meltwater, a company that provides services in online media monitoring.
Ryan Reeves, the director of people and talent for Meltwater, oversees hiring in the United States and tabled at the Career Fair looking for prospects to fill sales positions who would work with executives.
”Northeastern has students who have actual experience, which is cool,” Reeves said. “As someone who’s lived in Chicago, Austin, New York, it’s a unique type of program. You do graduate with guaranteed internship experience.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57869/campus/sga-updates-referendum-policy-to-allow-more-vetting-time-and-increase-transparency/,SGA updates policy to better evaluate referenda,"Yunkyo Kim, news staff","February 20, 2019","The Student Government Association, or SGA, announced on Feb. 14 changes to their policy for referendum submissions to adhere to campus, local and state laws in addition to adding criteria to better evaluate and prioritize referenda. 
Under the new policy, the executive cabinet of the SGA will convene to vet the referendum proposals and publish the meeting minutes within 48 hours. In addition, sponsors behind vetoed referenda will receive a detailed rationale highlighting the broken guidelines within 48 hours of the meeting.
SGA also moved the submission deadline from Feb. 18 to March 11, but did not alter the overall timeline of the vetting process. The submission form for proposed referenda was posted Feb. 10, and the original deadline was pushed back as SGA bylines state the referenda submission form needs to be posted a month before the deadline. 
“For a long time, there has been a conversation between the student government and the administration at Northeastern about trying to progress the referendum process to make it something that they will see more value in,” said SGA President Dylan Balcom, a third-year behavioral neuroscience major. “So when I got back this semester, we kind of hit the ground running and started drafting and communicating with the administration on what would be a fair referendum process.” 
SGA referenda allow the student body to vote directly on a question. The SGA historically has received five referenda per legislative cycle. During last year’s cycle, however, SGA President Dylan Balcom said they experienced a “large influx” of referendum submissions.
The change in the referendum vetting policy and delay of the timeline is to accommodate a growing number of sponsors as well as to promote transparency and objectivity of the vetting process while increasing the urgency of referenda to the administration. 
Jake Margolin, a fourth-year philosophy, politics and economics major who is on the executive board of the Roosevelt Institute at NU, praised the change. 
“Roosevelt members are very happy to see a full month for students to prepare and propose these referenda,” Margolin said. “We think that more time will lead to better referenda submissions. We thank the SGA administration for fixing it.” 
The Roosevelt Institute plans to propose a referendum to implement training for the prevention of sexual harassment and assault on campus, and resources for survivors. 
Matt Lowe, a second-year computer science and business administration major and president of the NU College Republicans, said the club has submitted a referendum every year and that the rationale behind the vetting process has not always been clear. 
“Essentially, all our referendums should pass every year — that’s not the way it always works out, but that is the idea behind it,” Lowe said. “So this year we are doing the same thing. Get something out there, and hopefully, we’ll enact change on campus.”
A larger-than-normal amount of referenda in 2018 made it hard for the university to prioritize one over another. The SGA legislation that enacted these changes includes, “There was an excess of referenda submitted to Senate in 2018 … If there are no changes made to the referenda procedures, the results may not be considered valid by the University Administration.”
Balcom said the changes are meant to be a “prioritization mechanism,” and that the university raised concerns about the increased volume of referenda.
With the implementation of the new policies, club sponsors will be able to see the reasoning behind vetoes. Lowe also praised the postponement of the deadline.
“[Submitting referenda] are important to our club. So that’s great to see that they pushed [the deadline] back, that they’re willing to show that they’re just willing to work with clubs on campus,” Lowe said.
Balcom said he hopes that the policy change will accommodate the increasing number of referenda and improve relations between the sponsors, student government and administration.
“We just want to have that open conversation,” Balcom said. “So that way, we know what the people’s aims are, what they are hoping to gain … it will make a better referendum if the student body and the student government are on the same page.”
Correction: An earlier version of this story mistakenly listed the reasoning for the referenda submission deadline extension and its date. The extension was done to comply with SGA BYLAWS and the date is March 11."

“There’s a long, positive relationship between SGA and SARC,” said Balcom, a third-year behavioral neuroscience major. “I have some areas where I am confident and I can speak some good truth on, and I am not that knowledgeable about sexual assault response on campus and where the gaps are.”
Last semester, SARC communicated with the D’Amore-McKim School of Business and the Khoury College of Computer Sciences on including the trainings in college introductory classes in those colleges. Through the meeting, Balcom and SARC members sought to identify next steps for prevention trainings going forward.
Olivia Bowman, SARC president and a third-year nursing major, said both organizations saw eye to eye on their immediate goals. 
“We do have a lot of things in common,” Bowman said. “We want to work on freshman orientations training, getting bystander training for the freshmen classes, getting training for the co-op classes for what to do if you are harassed if you’re in co-op.”
Balcom said he and SARC members are planning to schedule a follow-up meeting for further talks about the implementation of sexual assault prevention training. 
“We’ll figure out which colleges have it and don’t have it and then reach out to the deans and try to have this conversation,” Balcom said."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57873/campus/womens-interdisciplinary-society-of-entrepreneurship-gives-women-a-new-space-to-grow/,Women’s Interdisciplinary Society of Entrepreneurship gives women a new space to grow,"Deanna Schwartz, news staff","February 19, 2019","At the first session for the Husky Startup Challenge last semester, only 12 of the 112 attendees were women. As the competition continued, this number dwindled down to only one woman out of 40 finalists. 
For Mia Nguyen, the only female director of the program, this was “heartbreaking.” When Nguyen, a second-year business administration major, asked the other women why they dropped out, they said they were too intimidated and and felt it was too much of a “boy’s club.”
Nguyen and her fellow Entrepreneurs Club member Eliana Berger, a first-year combined business and psychology major, realized that there is a lack of female representation in the Northeastern business ecosystem. They decided to address the problem with the creation of Women’s Interdisciplinary Society of Entrepreneurship, or WISE, in January 2019.
WISE is a student organization “dedicated to increasing the confidence of young women and teaching them an entrepreneur mindset,” Nguyen said. 
WISE’s programming consists of three types of events: WeLearn, WeBuild and WeSupport.
WeLearn is a series of interactive workshops across various disciplines, with leaders brought in to teach workshops on their area of expertise. So far, workshops have been held on negotiation, venture capital, blogging, social media and other topics. The first WeLearn workshop in January focused on experience and user design, and had a turnout of more than 60 women, Nguyen said.
WeBuild and WeSupport are not fully launched yet, but will be in the fall. WeBuild is a series of startup classes held by an upperclassman or alum that requires an application. WeSupport is a mentorship network that pairs underclassmen with upperclassmen, and upperclassmen with successful alumni. 
This is neither Nguyen’s nor Berger’s first venture into starting a new organization — they both started businesses in high school. Nguyen started a portable phone charger company called CC Cords and Berger started a non-profit called Golden Heroes, which works to comfort children being treated for cancer. Their experiences dealing with gender discrimination through these ventures contributed to the birth of WISE.
Nguyen described struggling to maintain her femininity in the business world, and Berger said her authority was often doubted in favor of a male colleague. 
“I noticed a lot of times when I’d walk into a room, it would be completely male-dominated,” Berger said.
Part of what makes WISE unique is that it is accessible to students of any major.
“We’re eliminating the notion that you have to be a business major to be entrepreneurial,” Berger said. WISE has members from across all of Northeastern’s colleges, and the executive and advisory board represents all but one college. 
“WISE allows women from all different majors and backgrounds to explore different skills and find their strength,” said fifth-year psychology major Rosie Meyer, WISE’s vice president of community.
In addition to education, WISE places a large emphasis on creating a feeling of community for its members. Vice President of Design Aarti Amalean, a fifth-year interaction design and marketing combined major, said she finds the club to be “very empowering.”
“Women are using WISE to get to know each other and spend time together,” Nguyen said. 
Those involved with WISE believe that it has the potential to make a tangible difference.
“We’re providing a community that is otherwise hard to find,” Berger said.
Esther Chewning, a co-op coordinator for entrepreneurship and management, concurred that WISE is filling a gap that was previously not present for women in entrepreneurship. 
“[WISE] is a great opportunity for us to promote entrepreneurship and the benefits of it to our female students,” she said. 
In March, WISE is taking 30 women to the Google headquarters in Boston for a tour and a workshop on imposter syndrome, which is when a person doubts their accomplishments and feels like a fraud in their workplace or academic setting. 
Both Nguyen and Berger said they want to see WISE grow and flourish. 
“It’s amazing and it’s just the beginning,” Nguyen said."

https://huntnewsnu.com/57766/lifestyle/gallery-360-journeys-through-the-black-experience/,Gallery 360 journeys through the black experience,"Guy Ovadia, news correspondent","February 18, 2019","The “Personal to Political: Celebrating the African American Artists of Paulson Fontaine Press” exhibition in Gallery 360 is a journey through the black experience in America. It emphasizes the characteristics of African American history, conveys the state of contemporary black culture and informs the direction of the black identity.
“Personal to Political” is the traveling spring exhibition of Paulson Fontaine Press, an artist residency program in which artists take works in their primary medium and adapt them to a print format, and was curated by the Bedford Gallery at the Lesher Center for the Arts. Only about half of the exhibition is featured in the gallery in Ell Hall, Northeastern’s Gallery Director Thomas Vannatter said. 
The exhibition guides viewers through the work of 14 African American artists, each with their own interpretation of black culture. The result is a collection of distinct pieces that illustrates black history and how it has shaped black identity.
“Something I really enjoyed about the process of working on this exhibit was the movable hanging walls,” said fourth-year international affairs major Michael Manzon, who works as a co-op at Gallery 360. “Just by moving their position you can really transform how someone interacts with the room.” 
The gallery is made up of four sections, each tied together with its own aesthetic theme. The layout forms a weaving path that separates the distinct visual styles of the artists.
The entrance introduces a Kerry James Marshall piece portraying a woman resembling Harriet Tubman in an unusually dreamlike setting. Marshall is known for his work relating to the civil rights movement and the modern-day African American experience. 
The first section mostly contains work by David Huffman who is known for his Afrofuturist cultural aesthetic. This perspective views artistic movements like futurism and science fiction through a black lens. Huffman focuses less on the technological aspects of futurism and more on the direction of the African American cultural identity. “Traumabots” are recurring astronaut characters in Huffman’s work that scour Earth’s racist society in search of both an individual and communal sense of identity. 
“The main theme of his artwork is identity and really trying to create your own identity while still recognizing that you are part of a community that has been through trauma together,” Manzon said. “So it’s sort of the collective and the individual identity that you’re trying to both reconcile and keep distinct.”
Huffman relies heavily on urban cultural symbolism. Basketball is present in almost all of his pieces, but he also employs urban vernacular, exotic dancers, prison watchtowers and more as a way to illustrate the world through a black person’s eyes.
Huffman’s “Basketball Pyramid” is a commentary on the collective black culture that exists in unison with the individual identity. The pyramid symbol appears in a few of his pieces, including a sculpture version made of real basketballs.
“A lot of art is about the circumstances in which it was created,” said third-year marketing major Ryan Dent, who visited the exhibition. “Knowing the context of it does something to it.”
The second section contains the work of Martin Puryear followed by the aquatint work of Gary Simmons and McArthur Binion. These artists have a minimalist style, but their work couldn’t be more different.
Puryear, a sculptor known for sleek and abstract designs, recreated his signature sculptures as prints for the exhibition. 
“Martin Puryear really did get into printmaking as a medium, [and] it became a significant part of his practice,” Vannatter said.
Two prints show Puryear’s sculpture “Connecting,” which resides in the American embassy in Beijing, from different angles. Another is a side angle of his famous “Big Bling” in Fairmount Park in Philadelphia. He will represent the United States in the 2019 Venice Biennale, an international contemporary visual art exhibition held every two years.
Simmons’ style uses photos, aquatint and etching to produce scratchy, faded negatives on a monotone background. The acid-burning technique creates simple and bold erasure drawings of marquees.
Binion uses a similar technique but applies it to a matrix of photographs. The centerpiece of this section is red-tinted repeating grids of his own self-portrait. 
The final section features prints made by the historic Gee’s Bend quiltmakers, four women who carry on a tradition started in a remote African American community in Wilcox County, Alabama, in the early 20th century.
The authentic Gee’s Bend quilts themselves, which are priced in the thousands of dollars, are currently not on display in the exhibition. Instead, the exhibit shows prints of original quilt designs.
Quiltmakers are some of the most renowned self-taught black artists whose craft dates back to the abolitionist movement, and their work is considered by many to be some of the greatest pieces of modern American art.
The exhibit ends with an installation by Lava Thomas. Entitled “His Royal Discography,” it features purple tambourines each branded with an album by popular black music artist Prince.
“Prince is often credited with sort of expanding what the image of what a black man could be [and] the definition of black masculinity,” Manzon said. “That ties into the creation of one’s own identity in relation to the collective.”
The generation of black artists who witnessed the civil rights movement has a strong collective identity, but each individual has a unique perspective that, when put side by side, forms a mural which portrays a whole African American narrative.
“Personal to Political” is on display at Gallery 360 through March 13."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57860/campus/faculty-ask-about-non-stem-research-at-senate-meeting/,Faculty ask about non-STEM research at Senate meeting,"Maria Lovato, campus editor","February 18, 2019","Vice Provost for Research Innovation and Development David Luzzi gave a presentation on the state of student and faculty research at Northeastern during a Faculty Senate meeting Feb. 13, and fielded questions from faculty in the social sciences and humanities departments about how research is encouraged in their areas of study. 
The key programs held by the Center for Research Innovation, including RISE and Gap Fund 360, are typically dominated by technology, engineering and business proposals, Luzzi said. And while he is very interested in getting the social sciences and humanities more involved with research, he said he is not sure how to organize support or resources for “creative arts research.” 
“How do we facilitate more activity, that’s the question,” Luzzi said during his presentation, adding that Northeastern is on its way to becoming the first truly global research university, considering its rapid growth trajectory in research grant requests. 
Some faculty worry that too much focus is being placed on research that can be commercialized. Jennie Stephens, the director of the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs, said that in addition to the typical business and entrepreneurship ventures, there’s valuable research that has a social impact.
“I think it’s maybe just the word ‘entrepreneurship’ tends to be framed around making money,” she said. “And there’s a lot of research, social science research, that is more about humanity, the public good, and it’s not about making money.”
Luzzi also spoke about the impact of the government shutdown on NU. He said about 80 percent of Northeastern’s research funding is federal, and that NU had to use $4.6 million of its own money to sustain operations. After the shutdown ended, however, the federal government refunded the university in full."

Drexel (18-5, 10-2 CAA) picked apart Northeastern’s (15-9, 5-8 CAA) defense in the opening quarter, taking the lead at the first break 22-5. 
The opening quarter included a 14-0 run from the home team, getting the Dragons up 18-2 at one point, with marquee junior forward Bailey Greenberg racking up 11 first-quarter points. For the Huskies, junior guard Shannon Todd was the sole scorer with all five of Northeastern’s points at the end of ten minutes.
Freshman Kendall Currence came off the bench in the second looking to sway the tide. Currence hit back-to-back 3s for the Huskies as they started to chip away at the lead.
Another 7-0 run for the Dragons separated the two teams on the scoreboard even more as freshman guard Keishana Washington made her impact on the court in the process. With fellow guard Maura Hendrixson out due to injury, Washington made her mark in replacing Hendrixson, scoring 11 first-half points going a perfect 5-5 from the field.
With Drexel leading 39-14 at the halfway mark of the game, with its biggest lead of the season against any team, there were little signs from the Huskies that they were going to dig themselves out of the deficit. Northeastern racked up 15 first-half turnovers, which was 15 more than the Dragons.
On top of this, the Huskies only had two scorers in the game at the half. Both Currence and Todd with seven points apiece made up all 14 points the Huskies had accumulated through two periods of play.
There were some highlights for the Huskies, as freshman forward Alexis Hill managed to put in a last-second layup to break Drexel’s full court press, capping off a 20-point third quarter for Northeastern, compared to its 14-point first half.
Drexel was able to outscore the Huskies in each of the quarters and led from the opening whistle to the final buzzer. The Dragons would earn the 31-point drubbing of the Huskies, earning their 10th straight win for the first time in 10 years.
Greenberg, who has been the story of the season for the Dragons, led the game in scoring with 17 points, alongside three of her teammates who all scored double digits in the win. 
Shannon Todd and Kendall Currence finished the game as Northeastern’s top scorers, scoring 14 and 13 respectively. Todd also finished the game with four rebounds and two assists.

https://huntnewsnu.com/57855/sports/womens-hockey-stumbles-at-home-against-providence/,Women’s hockey stumbles at home against Providence,"Mike Puzzanghera, sports editor","February 17, 2019","A day after clinching the regular season Hockey East championship, the Huskies were stunned by Providence 5-2 at Matthews Arena Sunday, giving Northeastern only its second home loss of the year.
Saturday’s game saw the Huskies (22-5-4, 20-3-2 WHEA) beat the Friars (20-10-2, 14-9-2 WHEA) 3-1, putting them out of reach of Boston College in the Hockey East standings and securing first place.
On Sunday, however, Providence had the best look early, as forward Maureen Murphy skated in on NU goalkeeper Aerin Frankel on a breakaway. Frankel stayed composed in goal, however, and got down low to stop the chance with her pads.
But Providence continued attacking, and found the first goal through forward Sara Hjalmarsson. She attacked down the right wing against Husky defender Maddie Hartman. Hjalmarsson shifted the puck to her preferred left hand before rocketing a wrister bar-down to beat Frankel.
The Huskies hit back quickly on a 4-on-3 situation. After three penalties in the span of 31 seconds, the Huskies found themselves with the advantage, and sophomore defender Skylar Fontaine fired home her 10th of the season soon after the final penalty. Freshman forward Alina Mueller supplied the pass back toward Fontaine, who launched a one-time slap shot past PC netminder Madison Myers and in.
Northeastern continued to pressure, and given another power play chance at the end of the period, they capitalized once again. This time, Fontaine’s shot was saved by the pads of Myers, but the rebound found its way to senior forward Tori Sullivan at the left pipe. Sullivan made no mistake and slipped the puck in for her fifth score of the year.
The Friars leveled things up at 4:01 of the second as Hjalmarsson got her second of the game. Cassidy MacPherson played a pass across the face of goal, and Hjalmarsson got in a good position to shoot and snuck a shot past Frankel.
Just over a minute later, Providence got goal number three to take the lead from forward Neve Van Pelt. Van Pelt rolled a low shot toward the net from the right, and it slipped through the legs of Frankel and in.
The Friars’ dominance in the second period was shown in the shot margins: They outshot NU 11-4, and maintained heavy pressure in NU’s D-zone throughout the frame. It left NU head coach Dave Flint with plenty to tell his team at the break.
“I told them we need to simplify things and we need to start getting pucks to the net,” Flint said. “I think we were trying to do too much sometimes, making a pretty play instead of just getting pucks to the net and getting the puck down low. They came out that second period and they played desperate; they outworked us and we let them.”
Providence was yet again knocking on the doorstep at the start of the third, but they were thwarted by an incredible save by Frankel. After saving the first shot by Emily Landry, the rebound fell out to Hayley Lunny and it looked to be a sure fourth goal for the Friars. Frankel had other ideas, lunging across the goal and saving it with her stick at point-blank range and keeping the Huskies’ deficit at one.
But the Friars got their fourth through forward Christina Putigna minutes later, as she picked up a pass at the left circle and ripped her shot past Frankel.
An empty-netter by Meaghan Rickard wrapped things up for Providence, as they put five past the top defense in Hockey East.
“They played like the game meant more to them than it did to us and it did, they’re fighting for home ice and yesterday we locked up the regular season championship,” Flint said. “I think we got a little lackadaisical.”
The loss will not affect Northeastern in the Hockey East standings, but it could serve as a hit to their position in the Pairwise, as they are still looking to maintain a high ranking before the conference tournament.
The conference title NU clinched Saturday is just the second regular season Hockey East title in the program’s history, with the first coming in 2002.
“Especially in a league like Hockey East where its competitive top to bottom, for us to win the regular season championship, it’s quite an accomplishment for the girls, and we were definitely excited about it,” Flint said.
The Huskies will look to rebound when they take on Merrimack (16-10-6, 10-9-4 WHEA) Friday at Matthews Arena."

Northeastern (16-10, 10-4 CAA) found itself in a hole early on after Charleston connected on its first six shot attempts to take 16-8 lead. Guard Grant Riller and forward Jarrell Brantley have caused conference opponents problems all season, and their first-half performance certainly bolstered their reputation as a formidable duo — they amassed nine and 11 points respectively on a collective 5-13 shooting, leading the way at the end of the first period. 
Despite early hangups, the Huskies managed to claw their way back into the game. A 3-pointer from junior guard Donnell Gresham gave them a 33-32 advantage with 2:31 remaining in the half for Northeastern’s first lead since the opening possession, and Pusica got a 3 to go with six seconds remaining in the half to give the Huskies a 38-36 lead at the break. 
A layup from junior guard Bolden Brace capped off a 7-0 run to open the second half, and the Huskies looked destined to push the lead to double digits before Charleston’s one-two punch of Riller and Brantley responded. Riller scored the next eight points for the Cougars followed by back-to-back buckets for Brantley, and the two were largely responsible for a 13-0 run that gave Charleston a 55-52 lead with 7:24 remaining. 
Gresham connected on another three to tie the game at 55 with 6:30 left, but Riller got a mid-range jumper to go the following possession and Northeastern would trail over the next six minutes. Junior guard Jordan Roland broke out for a fastbreak layup with just 29 seconds remaining in the game, tying the game at 69, and the Huskies fended off Charleston on the final possession to force a second overtime in the last three games. 
Unfortunately for Northeastern, this overtime period didn’t go as well as last week’s effort against Elon in which they scored 12 unanswered points. Riller and Brantley combined for 14 of Charleston’s 19 in overtime and the Huskies simply couldn’t keep up.
Pusica led the way for Northeastern once again, leading the team with 25 points on an efficient 9-15, including 5-10 from behind the arc. Brace added 13 points and 11 rebounds, giving him his third double-double in five games. The Huskies shot an impressive 50.9 percent from the field — the major discrepancy came at the free throw line, as Charleston outshot the Huskies 22-9 from the charity stripe. 
Northeastern falls to 16-10 (10-4 CAA) with the loss, but they maintain a half-game lead over Charleston (21-7, 10-5 CAA) for second place in the conference. The Huskies return to Matthews Arena for their final homestand of the regular season to take on James Madison (12-15, 5-9 CAA) this Thursday."

After defeating UVM 4-1 Friday despite being outshot, NU won 2-1 on Saturday and also had the upper hand in the shot column.
It was the Huskies’ 19th win this season, tying the 2018-19 squad for the eighth most victories in NU history and moving Northeastern to 19-9-1 (11-7-1 HEA), while Vermont dropped to 12-16-2 (5-13-2 HEA). NU finished the weekend 11th in the Pairwise rankings, the top 16 of which qualify for the NCAA Tournament.
Northeastern controlled the game from the start. Just 56 seconds into regulation, senior forward Lincoln Griffin scored the first goal of the game for the Huskies when he entered the UVM zone on a 2-on-1 with senior forward Liam Pecararo. Head coach Jim Madigan said a stronger start was one of his top goals set after Friday’s rough first period.
“It was a key message for us, and I thought our start was excellent,” Madigan said. “I thought tonight we really responded with a much better effort and focus.”
The Huskies started with a bang again in the second when Matt Filipe took advantage of a Vermont penalty and put one past UVM goaltender Stefanos Lekkas at 2:52, redirecting freshman defender Julian Kislin’s shot. The Vermont offense was finally able to put one past sophomore goaltender Cayden Primeau less than a minute into the final frame when freshman forward Joey Cipollone scored on the power play.
Primeau had another great game, saving 23 of 24 shots, including a crucial stop early in the third when Vermont looked to tie up the game on the power play. Senior captain Eric Williams hit a personal milestone, playing in his 146th consecutive game and breaking the program record. 
The Huskies are on the road next weekend for a two-game series against New Hampshire, but will be back in Matthews on March 2 to take on Boston College."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57847/sports/womens-basketball-falls-at-delaware/,Women’s basketball falls at Delaware,"Vincent van Oorschot, news staff","February 17, 2019","Northeastern’s CAA road record has once again been dented after Delaware picked up a hard-fought victory against the Huskies, 77-63 on Friday night. This marks the third loss in NU’s last four CAA matchups.
“It was transition points and it was rebounds,” head coach Kelly Cole said were the focal points of Friday’s game.
Both squads set a furious pace to open up the game, with transition baskets coming left, right and center. Northeastern (15-8, 5-7 CAA) snatched an early lead. 
With both teams making their shots in the opening quarter, there was little separation, but due to Delaware’s efficiency in the last three minutes of the quarter, the Blue Hens (11-12, 6-5 CAA) took the lead 19-14 at the end of the first.
Poor shooting seemed to be the abnormality of the opening half for the Huskies, who so far this season have been shooting at 41.6 percent from the field. Northeastern’s first half Friday night against Delaware was one of its worst halves this season, going 32.1 percent from the field, alongside 20 percent from the 3-point line.
The Huskies were not to be counted out heading into the second half, though. Delaware struggled to pull away from the Huskies due to poor free-throw shooting. The Blue Hens were 7-12 from the line with only a seven-point lead at the half.
Another theme throughout the game was Northeastern’s inability to control the boards. By the end of the game the Blue Hens demolished the Huskies 52-36 on the glass, including 21 offensive boards.
“I know we know how do it [rebounding], and I know we’re certainly capable of doing it,” said Coach Cole after the game. “We just didn’t have our minds locked on to it tonight.”
 A major talking point for the Huskies all week had been rebounds but Northeastern was unable to capitalize throughout the matchup.
Northeastern couldn’t raise its shooting efficiency in a comeback bid on the road, finishing the game at 34.5 percent. This allowed Delaware to finish the game with a strong last quarter, outscoring the Huskies 30-20 and capping off a 14-point victory against an outfit that was fresh off a win against Towson last week.
Delaware’s player of the game was Samone Defreese; the junior scored 31 points along with nine rebounds, just short of a double-double.
For the Huskies, Shannon Todd was the leading scorer. The junior guard finished the night with 15 points along with three 3-pointers and four rebounds. Other double-digit scorers for Northeastern included sophomore guard Stella Clark (14) and senior guard Jess Genco (11).
The Huskies head to Drexel Sunday afternoon at the as they seek a retaliation win against the Dragons after Drexel nailed a game-winner against Northeastern at the buzzer last time out in Boston."

Despite struggling offensively midweek, the Huskies burst out of the gates with a two-goal first period, the first of which came from sophomore defender Skylar Fontaine. Attacking on the power play, junior defender Codie Cross slipped a pass back to Fontaine in their own D-zone, allowing Fontaine to take the puck all the way up the ice. She made her way through the defense toward the left side of the goal, unleashing a shot that flew past Providence goalkeeper Madison Myers and in off the post.
The goal was Fontaine’s eighth of the year and her first power-play goal of the season. Cross got her eighth assist of the season, the only assist on the goal.
The Huskies got a second goal later in the period from junior forward Matti Hartman. Hartman picked off a Providence pass in the neutral zone and skated forward, finding space on the right wing to release a shot. Her effort went past Myers at her far post for the 2-0 advantage.
Northeastern generated 17 shots on goal in the first period, forcing Myers to make 15 saves. It was a strong opening period for a team coming off a tough loss, and it boded well for the remainder of the game.
Providence snagged a goal back in the second period on the power play. Frankel saved an initial effort, but Providence forward Meaghan Rickard was able to latch onto the rebound and tuck home to make it 2-1.
The Huskies kept the Friars at bay for the rest of the second period, Frankel making 12 saves in the period.
Northeastern came out swinging at the start of the third and found a third goal for their efforts. Fontaine was the scorer again, this time finding a rebound in space on the right wing and, with Myers out of position, slipping the puck past her for her second of the game.
This was Fontaine’s first career multi-goal game at the collegiate level. The sophomore has registered 24 points on the season with nine goals and 15 assists and is second in Hockey East with a plus-34 rating.
Despite being outshot 11-5 in the third period, the Huskies kept Providence off the board in the frame and held on for the win. Frankel stopped all 11 shots to bring her total up to 31 for the day.
With the win, the Huskies clinched the regular season Hockey East title. They clinched at least a share of it with their win over Merrimack last Friday but needed just one more point to put themselves out of reach of Boston College at the top.

Things started slowly for NU in its first game since winning the Beanpot on Monday. The win at TD Garden was an emotional high, but the reality in the standings is a little more serious for the Huskies: After losing at Connecticut last Thursday, NU came into Friday’s bout tied for fifth in Hockey East. Friday had the potential to vault them into third or drop them back into a tie for eighth.
Albert TamuraChaos reins on the ice for a moment during Northeastern’s 4-1 win Friday night.
NU went to the locker room for the first intermission after being outshot 16-5 in the opening 20 minutes. After the game, head coach Jim Madigan said his team was “skating in quicksand” during the period. Junior defender Jeremy Davies said they had a sort of reality check at that point.
“We came out flat in the first there, and then we regrouped,” Davies said. “It was just realizing what this game meant in the standings and in the Pairwise. You never want to lose in Hockey East this late in the season, and I think that was reflected in our play later on in the game.”
Albert TamuraDefenseman Ryan Shea skates away from an outstretched Vermont player as Cayden Primeau looks on.
The second period was a closer 8-6 Vermont edge in shots, and NU was able to get a key equalizing goal after UVM opened the scoring early in the period.
At 7:01 of the second, Alex Esposito took a 2-on-1 feed from Liam Coughlin and beat Primeau short side as the sophomore goalie was moving laterally.
It was important for NU to respond before the intermission; scoring has been hard to come by for this team, and UVM had been clogging up passing lanes and blocking shots to frustrate the Huskies all night long.
They got that crucial equalizer at 13:33 of the middle period on a long shot by defenseman Ryan Shea. John Picking found the puck in the corner, turned and made a nice pass out to Shea at the point, who floated a shot through traffic that somehow got past UVM goalie Stefanos Lekkas.
NU took the lead for good in a third period that saw them finally find their legs, as Madigan put it after the game. At 4:21 of the final frame, junior winger Matt Filipe found a loose puck at the side of the net with Lekkas down. He pounced on it and flipped it into the goal for the 2-1 lead.
“We challenged them to find a way to win between the second and third,” Madigan said. “We’re fighting for a playoff spot, they’re fighting for a playoff spot. We stuck to it.”

At 17:13, Picking scored on a beautiful shot to to give his team a cushion. He skated down the right wing on a 2-on-1, kept the puck as he drifted toward the middle and shot a laser into the top corner. An empty-netter by Lincoln Griffin at 18:52 to make it 4-1 was more cosmetic than necessary.
Picking notched two points in his first game since January 26th, and Madigan was encouraged by the lack of rust on the fourth-line center.
“I thought he was excellent. He hadn’t practiced since January, and his first practice back here was on Tuesday,” Madigan said. “He was excellent at the face-off dot, great second effort in the D zone, and he had a big-time shot to create some separation at the end of the game.”
Primeau is fresh off a Beanpot MVP award, and bailed out his team again Friday night. His 32 saves were impressive on their own, but the 16 he made in the first period were all-important.
“Without Cayden Primeau in goal, we probably don’t get out of the first 0-0. It’s probably 2-0 or 3-0,” Madigan said.
The Huskies face Vermont again Saturday night with a chance to build off of their critical win Friday."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57827/editorial/op-ed-trumps-sotu-speech-was-predictably-problematic/,Op-ed: Trump’s SOTU speech was predictably problematic,"Deanna Schwartz, news staff","February 15, 2019","President Donald J. Trump is a liar.
This is widely recognized. According to a Washington Post analysis from December, Trump averaged 15 false claims per day in 2018. While many media outlets are hesitant to call Trump a liar outright, I’m going to say it. 
His State of the Union address last Tuesday was no exception, with Trump making one false claim every two minutes. Trump lied about the usual — economic growth, the creation of new jobs, border crime, abortion, etc. 
It has gotten to the point where it is nearly impossible to believe anything he says. Even when Trump isn’t directly lying, he’s misleading the American public. He spins facts to fit his narrative that he has “made America great again.”
During the State of the Union, he claimed “more people are working now than at any time in our history.” This is true, but has nothing to do with Trump. The population in the United States is higher than ever before, meaning more people are working than ever before, the New York Times pointed out.
Lies aside, Trump’s speech was problematic. He didn’t mention the shutdown once. It’s egregious that, in a speech originally meant to inform Americans about what is happening in the country, Trump did not discuss the government shutdown that left nearly 800,000 federal workers without pay for 35 days. 
Trump brought attention to his guests not out of true sympathy for their trauma, but as an attempt at pathos. He highlighted the relatives of a couple killed by an alleged undocumented immigrant to bolster his argument for a wall and a ten-year-old cancer survivor as the face of his administration’s campaign against cancer. Another of his honored guests was a student bullied for having the last name “Trump” — an insult to children who are bullied for their skin color, religion or sexuality.
He threw out buzz words left and right to energize his fan base. “Wall” was said 12 times, “illegal” 10 times, “dangerous” four times and “winning” three times. 
The choice to devote a portion of his speech to discussing the Holocaust upset me greatly. As a Jewish person, I am disappointed with the way Trump handles issues of anti-Semitism. After he defended neo-Nazis in Charlottesville and said that the Tree of Life synagogue tragedy could have been prevented had there been an armed guard, how am I supposed to believe anything he says about anti-Semitism is genuine? 
Trump claims that there is a moral duty to create an effective immigration system. What about the moral duty for compassion? 
He claims to want to protect young migrant children. How can he pretend to care about migrant youth when they die at detention camps? 
If “walls save lives,” why are people dying in the custody of Border Patrol?
The State of the Union was nothing out of the ordinary for Donald Trump. Unfortunately, the ordinary is filled with lies, misleading statements and dangerous rhetoric."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57797/sports/hampered-huskies-win-5th-straight-with-massive-second-half/,Hampered Huskies win 5th-straight with massive second half,"Seamus McAvoy, news staff","February 14, 2019","Northeastern’s penultimate road trip of the 2018-19 season began ominously when Vasa Pusica was scratched due to illness, but a 48-point second half propelled the Huskies to an 81-77 win over North Carolina Wilmington on Thursday, their ninth win in 10 games. 
The Huskies (16-9, 10-3 CAA) fielded a weakened lineup against UNCW (8-19, 4-10 CAA) that consisted of only eight healthy players. Shortly before tip, the valuable senior guard Pusica joined junior guard Shawn Occeus (ankle) on the list of contributors forced to miss time, and freshman forward Jason Strong was thrust into the starting lineup for just the third time this season. 
Junior guard Bolden Brace got things started for Northeastern with a 3-pointer on their opening possession, and he went on to lead the team in scoring at the half with seven points on 3-6 shooting. Junior guards Jordan Roland and Donnell Gresham Jr. backed him up with six and five points respectively, and the Huskies tallied a modest 33 points in the opening period in the absence of two of their best scorers. 
It was the defensive side of the ball that Northeastern struggled with early on, as UNCW’s offense exploded for a 25-3 run over an eight-minute stretch. A 3-pointer from guard Ty Gadsden capped off the half for the Seahawks, giving them a 44-33 lead at the break. 
It didn’t take long for the tide to turn in favor of the Huskies — Roland connected on back-to-back 3s, and another triple from Roland minutes later cut UNCW’s lead to down to three. Northeastern finally took the lead with 9:27 remaining after a fastbreak jumper from Brace gave the Huskies a 61-60 advantage. 
The decisive run came with just over six minutes left, kicked off by a layup from Roland which made it 67-66 in favor of the Huskies. Sophomore guard Myles Franklin got a jumper to go after senior center Anthony Green collected an offensive rebound, and Green’s effort was rewarded on the following possession when Brace set him up for an easy dunk. 
From there, Northeastern was able to put the game to bed behind a 7-8 stretch from the free throw line by Gresham, who finished with 17 points, four rebounds and four assists. Roland led the Huskies in scoring with 19 on 7-15 shooting, and Green notched a double-double with 12 points and 11 rebounds. Brace continued his strong output in conference play adding 16 points, six rebounds and three assists. 
With the victory, Northeastern stays in second in the conference with a record of 16-9 (10-3 CAA). The Huskies bring a five-game win streak into Charleston (20-7, 9-5 CAA) this Saturday in a crucial conference matchup."

https://huntnewsnu.com/57787/lifestyle/musics-biggest-night-honors-hip-hop-and-country/,Music’s biggest night honors hip-hop and country,"Claire Wallace, news correspondent","February 13, 2019","On Sunday, CBS aired the 61st annual Grammy Awards with a lineup including Diana Ross, Jennifer Lopez, Lady Gaga, Smokey Robinson, Kacey Musgraves and many more, with Alicia Keys hosting. 
“I was really rooting for Lady Gaga,” said Anna Rychlik, a second-year business major. “And I was proud of Kacey Musgraves, her album was beautiful.”
Viewers praised Keys for honoring women, including bringing out a group of famous females including former First Lady Michelle Obama, wearing no make-up and partaking in her own special performance in which she played two pianos simultaneously. 
Aside from being a star-studded evening, this years Grammys were also a night of firsts as Cardi B became the first woman to win a Grammy for Best Rap Album with her 2018 album “Invasion of Privacy.” 
Mastering engineer Emily Lazar became the first woman to win a Grammy for Best Engineered Album. Actor Donald Glover, known in the music industry by his pseudonym Childish Gambino, became the first ever hip-hop artist to win Song of the Year with his politically-charged single “This Is America.” “This Is America” also took home the Grammy for Record of the Year and Best Music Video. 
Despite his big win, Glover chose not to attend the ceremony, citing the way he, and many other hip-hop artists, feel about their unfair treatment by the awards. Artists like Glover, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Drake criticize the award selection board for not paying enough attention to their genre. During Sunday’s show, Drake spoke up about some of these issues during his acceptance speech for Best Rap Song, but was cut off by producers.
“Look, if there are people who have regular jobs who are coming out in the rain and the snow, spending their hard-earned money to buy tickets to come to your shows, you don’t need this [award] right here. I promise you,” Drake said in his speech. 
Many viewers saw this as a direct attack on the show, with a number of fans expressing their disappointment in the show online for cutting Drake off during his speech by moving the camera back to Keys.
Cardi B’s Best Rap Album win also garnered a considerable amount of online attention. Fans of the late hip-hop artist Mac Miller were disappointed that the rapper’s album “Swimming” did not take home the Grammy in the wake of his death in September. 
“I wish they had done more of a recognition for Mac Miller,” said Campbell Brown, a second-year business major.  
Many fans, including Mac Miller’s ex-girlfriend pop artist Ariana Grande, expressed their anger at the show for inviting Miller’s parents to fly to California for the ceremony to watch their son lose. After the show, Cardi B posted a video to her Instagram account in which she thanked Miller and said she was sharing the award with him. 
Out of all of the performances at this year’s ceremony, the one that viewers were perhaps the most split on was pop artist Lady Gaga’s. Gaga performed the Grammy-nominated “Shallow” from the 2018 film “A Star Is Born,” which took home awards for Best Song Written for Visual Media and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. 
The internet went crazy following her performance, with some saying she looked crazy and not put together or prepared, while others defended Gaga saying that it’s simply her typical performance style. 
“I really enjoyed Lady Gaga’s performance because of the production value,” said Franny Kuth, a second-year design major. “I thought she sounded incredible.” 
One of the biggest awards of the night, Album of the Year, went to country artist Kacey Musgraves, who performed her song “Rainbow” during the ceremony. Musgraves took home three other awards in country music categories.
“Kacey Musgraves is really talented, but I did not expect her to beat all of the other nominees,” Brown said. “I was shocked but very happy for her.” 
This year’s Person of the Year award and tribute performance also went to a country star: Dolly Parton. Parton performed in her own tribute performance alongside performers including Kacey Musgraves, Katy Perry and her goddaughter Miley Cyrus. 
This year’s ceremony proved to be a historic one for women, hip-hop artists and other music industry minorities. 
“SZA and Kendrick [Lamar] didn’t win for [their song on] “Black Panther” which is so sad because that album and song is so good,” Kuth said. “But overall, the more famous [categories] such as Best New Artist, Best Album and Record of the Year were good.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57785/campus/second-annual-black-market-showcases-black-owned-businesses/,Second annual Black Market showcases black-owned businesses,"Maria Lovato, campus editor","February 13, 2019","More than 15 black-owned businesses selling everything from skincare products to literotica were at the Black Market event in the Cabral Center Wednesday. 
Lori Nsimpasi, the president of Northeastern’s Black Student Association, or NBSA, organized the event. She said the event was inspired by the Black Market in Roxbury’s Dudley Square.
“[That market] brings in black-owned businesses to the space and location where people can help purchase from them and also support black-owned businesses around Boston,” said Nsimpasi, a fourth-year criminal justice and psychology major. “So this is inspired by them, hence the name Black Market. We decided to now bring it to a college campus and hopefully collab with them in the future … so we can cater to college students.
This is the second annual Black Market at Northeastern, and Nsimpasi said they’re “trying to make it bigger and better each year.”
Erykah Kangbeya, a second-year nursing major, came to the market at the recommendation of a friend.  
“I was thinking of buying a couple headwraps and stuff like that,” she said. “I’m personally from the Ivory Coast of West Africa, so French is my first language, so it’s kind of nice to be here.”
Rickie Thompson, co-founder of Prime Taste of Africa, sold Afrocentric merchandise including shea butter, jewelry and soap, mostly from Ghana and West Africa.
“A lot of our things are from Africa, and some are not from Africa, but they’re Afrocentric and designed in spirit,” he said, holding up a piece homemade soap. “This is African black soap from Ghana. It’s very good for your skin. It’s very popular, we sell a lot of it.”
Thompson’s company is based in Hyde Park and often sells at events around town. He said that when he received an email from NBSA, he knew he had to come.
Maria LovatoNaomi Williams and Dominique Charles, creators of Pleasant Aroma, sit at their booth in in the Cabral Center on Feb. 13.
Other brands included Pleasant Aroma, a candle company created by Naomi Williams and Dominique Charles, and SoBos Apparel, a clothing company that encourages people to take control of their circumstances and be bosses, according to their website. 
“The Frolic’s Charisma,” a book by Khalid Mustafa, was also sold at the market. This book is self-described to be “the optimum voyeuristic passage of seduction, romance and passion.”
“There’s also a couple venders that are students as well,” Nsimpasi said, “so this also helps serve our own student population and help them promote their business within the college community. So we reach[ed] out to them, of course, and made sure they had a spot in this event.”
Jada Turner, an NU alum, also attended. She is the founder of BGM Apparel, which stands for Black Girl Magic. 
“It started while I was in grad school at Northeastern. [I] just [got] inspired about supporting black women, supporting all that they do, all that they contribute to society,” said Turner, who graduated in 2014 as a business administration major. 
Turner said she uses her brand as a “vehicle for [her] own passions,” including graphic design. She also uses her company to provide opportunities for students.
“For example, I did a bunch of internships, so I had people as social media … somebody that ran the photoshoots, somebody that was managing our content on the website,” she said. “So, I use it to share my skills and share the platform that I’ve created while I was at Northeastern, and the community has supported me.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57768/campus/nu-parking-to-be-managed-by-private-company/,NU parking to be managed by private company,"Lukas Illion, news correspondent","February 13, 2019","As of July 2019, Northeastern’s  Boston campus parking system will be managed by Queensland Investment Corporation, or QIC. Northeastern announced the 50-year agreement with the Australian investment firm Jan. 28 in an email sent to faculty and staff as well as student parking permit holders from Thomas Nedell, senior vice president for finance and treasurer. 
“Northeastern does not want to be in the business of parking,” Northeastern professor of finance Eliot Sherman said. “If someone is better at managing parking, the university would rather let them do that.”
Sherman said that basic business principles state that the university should delegate services like parking to another company if that company can perform the service even slightly better. This explains why Northeastern has relinquished the management of its dining services to Chartwells and its bookstore to Barnes and Noble.
According to the email, Northeastern will receive an unspecified “upfront capital commitment from QIC that will allow Northeastern to make substantial new investments in the university’s core mission.” In other words, QIC will pay Northeastern to manage its parking facilities. In turn, Northeastern can use QIC’s initial payment to grow its endowment and advance its academic goals. 
Both QIC and Nedell declined to comment on the announcement. 
While hundreds of universities have transferred management of their bookstores and dining services to external corporations, parking facilities have not followed this trend. NU is the first private university in the country to sign this type of agreement, according to the press release. Northeastern is preceded only by Ohio State University, a public university that signed a similar deal with QIC in 2013. 
Sherman said this difference may be due to the lack of parking complexity compared to dining and bookstore management. 
“Managing the parking facilities is easier and less onerous for the university,” Sherman said. “Whereas a large proportion of students come into contact with campus food services and Northeastern merchandise, a smaller subset of students, faculty and staff utilize the parking facilities.”
In addition to its upfront payment, QIC also said in a press release that it will continue to invest in Northeastern’s parking infrastructure in the future by funding “major technology upgrades and integrating mobile technologies into its services.” 
While this aspect of the deal remains vague, the most concrete promises relate to price. According to Nedell’s email, “Beginning in 2019-2020, annual rate increases will be tempered from what [NU has] experienced and the maximum annual increase will decline every year for the next decade.” 
After 2028, price increases will cap at four percent per year, Nedell said. For the 2018-19 school year, parking prices increased by about nine percent for undergraduate day passes as well as faculty and staff passes.
OSU’s deal provides a test case for what Northeastern can expect from this new deal moving forward. According to the Lantern, OSU’s student newspaper, parking rates “regularly met, or in some instances exceeded, the 5.5 percent annual increase initially agreed to.” 
While parking prices have increased at OSU, according to a press release from QIC, QIC has “invested more than $24 million in major facility repair projects [at OSU] to ensure that the parking system will be maintained and optimized over a 50-year period.”
If Northeastern’s deal is anything like OSU’s, the university community can expect continued — but now stabilized — rate increases from year to year. 
For now, parking is an infrequently debated topic compared with other services at Northeastern. 
Second-year business and communications major Caitlyn Ortutay parks in an on-campus garage. “I don’t really have any problems with the parking here,” she said.
However, as parking prices rise, more students may leave their cars at home or in cheaper garages. 
Some students like Laura Hines, a second-year biology major, feel unaffected by the parking changes. “There’s no reason to have a car in the city,” she said, since she is still taking classes on campus. 
However, she recognized that this is not the case for all students. “Some people do need parking for co-op and Northeastern should make that affordable,” Hines said.

https://huntnewsnu.com/57778/campus/n-u-in-and-transfer-students-dismayed-by-housing-assignment-far-from-campus/,N.U.in and transfer students dismayed by housing assignment far from campus,"Jenna Clark, news correspondent","February 13, 2019","When first-year communication studies major Grace Carolonza applied for apartment-style on-campus housing at Northeastern, she never expected to be put in an apartment almost an hour’s walk to campus. 
“When I looked on the map, I saw it was closer to Boston University and a 50-minute walk from Northeastern,” Carolonza said. “This would make it challenging to become involved in clubs and meet people, two crucial aspects when one is trying to become integrated in a community. Commonwealth would be isolating, and this could be detrimental to a freshman who is unfamiliar with the Northeastern community.”
1110 Commonwealth Ave. is a Northeastern housing complex in Allston, near Boston University. Carolonza received her housing assignment while in Rome with the N.U.in program. She said she put the location in a map in her phone multiple times because she couldn’t believe the location.
The Commonwealth Avenue property is former Boston University housing that Northeastern currently leases. Third-year English and psychology major Crystal Lau said everyone she knows there is either an N.U.in or exchange student. It consists of two-person studio apartments and three-person apartments with single rooms. 
Students who live there are not required to have a meal plan like first-years who live on-campus. To aid in the 40-minute public-transit commute, which requires one transfer, they receive an unlimited T pass for each semester. In addition, a Northeastern shuttle leaves Commonwealth seven times daily to bring students to campus.
Lau, an exchange student from Hong Kong, takes the shuttle to campus in the morning, but said there aren’t always enough seats, and sometimes drivers leave before the scheduled departure time.
Lau was originally placed into housing at the Midtown Hotel on Huntington Avenue. She said it looked “sketchy” at first, but she liked the location near campus. After living there for about a week, Lau and her roommate were told they had to leave and would be put in permanent housing on Commonwealth Avenue.
“I wasn’t super happy about it at first because I’d settled into Midtown,” Lau said. “Once you unpack everything, you don’t want to put it all back. It’s literally so far off campus, it kind of feels like they didn’t want to deal with us so just sent us off far, far away.”
Lau said she was upset at first, but recognizes that living in Commonwealth has its upsides, such as having her own kitchen. Lau said she made the situation work, but if the housing department told her a place on campus opened up, she would definitely move.
Carolonza found alternative housing on her own before she even arrived on campus from N.U.in. She didn’t want to live too far from campus because of safety concerns, and she thought it would be more difficult to make friends, so she contacted the housing office to see what her options were. 
They allowed her to drop her housing deposit, so she and her roommates were able to find off-campus housing on Worcester Street, a 10 to 15-minute walk from campus, for less money than they would have paid for Commonwealth. 
Carolonza said she is very happy with her decision but feels lucky she was able to find good off-campus housing on such a short notice. She said she thinks students should have been made aware they could be placed in housing far away from campus when they applied for apartment-style housing.
“We the students have the right to be informed and, for the tuition being paid, a right to not submit to a 50-minute walk to campus,” Carolonza said.
Sabrina Rigby, a first-year media and screen studies and political science combined major, was assigned to live in Commonwealth. She participated in N.U.in in Prague and remembers feeling frustrated and helpless when she found out.
“I was livid,” Rigby said. “That night that I found out, a bunch of us stayed up complaining about it until like 2 a.m. We were just like, ‘There has to be a way out of it. We have to be able to do something.’ We felt so powerless and so pissed off.”
The day after she found out about her housing, Rigby’s parent contacted the housing office. The day before coming to the Boston campus, Rigby found out she would eventually be placed in on-campus housing, but didn’t know when or to where she would move. Rigby lived in Commonwealth for more than a week before moving into to a traditional freshman dorm.
Rigby said she did not like living in Commonwealth because she had to wake up at 6 a.m. to get to campus on time, then couldn’t leave until late in the evening and wasn’t able to go home in between classes. She said she also felt concerned for her safety taking the T home alone at night.
“If you could pick up Comm Ave. and bring it over closer to Northeastern within a decent walking distance, I would have been like, ‘I’m going to stay here. This is great.’ It was really the location,” Rigby said.
Of eight students from the N.U.in Prague program that were placed in Commonwealth, all have since moved to on-campus housing. Rigby said Northeastern should stop leasing housing that isn’t within walking distance from campus. 
“You can’t call it on-campus housing, and you shouldn’t call it on-campus housing if I literally could have gone to BU so much faster,” Rigby said. “Maybe it’s cheaper, but at the end of the day, that’s definitely not worth it, especially considering how much stress that puts on the housing department.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57750/lifestyle/scout-gets-real-about-impostor-phenomenon/,Scout gets real about impostor phenomenon,"Nia Beckett, lifestyle editor","February 13, 2019","Members and guests gathered in Shillman Hall on Thursday for the student-led design studio Scout’s first panel on impostor syndrome, titled “Fake It Till You Make It.”
Scout marketing and events director Camaryn McKenzie introduced the event with a short video a former Scout member showed her when McKenzie felt unworthy of being at Northeastern. The video features a voice-over from an interview in which radio-personality Ira Glass speaks on the initial stages of working in a creative field.
Department of Art + Design co-op coordinator Dori Mazor moderated the event and revealed the misnomer of the evening’s topic. About 70 percent of the population experiences “impostor syndrome,” which, as Mazor noted, is not a syndrome at all, and more accurately labeled as “impostor phenomenon.”
“If you think you have impostor phenomenon, you’re in good company,” Mazor said, going on to name celebrities such as Michelle Obama and Natalie Portman who have expressed similar feelings.
According to a 2011 journal article in the International Journal of Behavioral Science, individuals with the impostor phenomenon “experience intense feelings that their achievements are undeserved and worry that they are likely to be exposed as a fraud.”
Five panelists discussed their experiences with impostor phenomenon, both in Scout and at Northeastern. The group gave several strategies that help them overcome the feelings.
For panelist and fifth-year international affairs major Katie Wilhoit, that means “going and talking with other people … but also finding mentors.”
The idea of seeking mentorship was a common thread throughout the event.
“If you ask someone for help, nine times out of 10, they’ll be open to helping,” said panelist Molly O’Neill, a Northeastern graduate and founder of the design studio Juno.
Another topic was dealing with failure. After Scout denied her designer application, panelist Elizabeth Cavallo, a third-year marketing major, tried her hand at the “logistics side” of Scout and has since worked her way up to a project lead position.
“You never know where you’ll have talents,” Cavallo said.
Scout member and third-year graphic design major Laura Shrago appreciated hearing about the panel’s experiences with “different things that in the moment seemed like the end of the world … and they ended up being okay.”
“It’s kind of reassuring in a weird way,” Shrago said.
The panel closed with final pieces of advice for the audience.
Panelist Bailey Kane, a fifth-year computer engineering and computer science major, said it’s helpful to reassure himself by viewing his progress comparatively and retracing his steps.
“I’ve done X, Y, Z before, and I’ll do it again,” Kane said.
The topic for Thursday’s panel arose from McKenzie’s conversations around co-op applications opening after realizing a lot of her peers felt as though they were unqualified.
“I wanted to open up the conversation and let everyone know they’re not alone,” McKenzie said.
Scout is hosting its second annual design conference “Interventions: Narrative” on April 6."

Charlie Baker’s state budget plan, released Jan. 23, contains a new proposal aimed at reining in the cost of prescription drugs within the state’s Medicaid program, otherwise known as MassHealth. The plan would also dramatically increase state oversight of drug prices. 
Baker’s office is seeking a change in state law to allow direct negotiation of high drug prices between MassHealth and drug manufacturers. If negotiations are unsuccessful, those companies would be referred for further oversight to the Health Policy Commission, or HPC, which is not yet tasked with keeping drug prices in check.  
Should the HPC find prices excessive, the drug manufacturer could be referred to the state attorney general’s office for further investigation and potential legal action on the grounds of violation of consumer protection laws. 
Wendy Parmet, a professor at Northeastern University School of Law and leading expert on health, disability and public health law, said the proposal is a step up from its previous iterations.
“I think people are supporting it because they see it as a potential first step for the state to take some action to rein in the price of pharmaceuticals in a way that would focus on the price, not the access,” Parmet said. “It doesn’t raise some of the red flags and problems that the prior proposal had.” 
The proposal comes as Massachusetts drug spending is rising, increasing from $1.1 billion to $1.9 billion from 2012 to 2017, which surpasses spending growth throughout the rest of the program. In the proposal, administration officials project that the move would save the state $80 million in the next fiscal year alone.
The Baker administration made a proposal with a similar goal last year that involved excluding certain high-priced drugs from Medicaid coverage and moving thousands of people off the program. Federal approval for that proposal was denied.
Baker’s most recent proposal does not include either of those measures and would only change state law, thus not requiring federal approval.
Many from the pharmaceutical industry, however, have criticized the proposal, arguing that such attempts by the state to regulate prices inhibit research and development. 
Massachusetts Biotechnology Council president Robert K. Coughlin said in a Jan. 23 statement that the proposal “sends a message across the industry that government is going to punish success and that only it can be the final arbiter of drug pricing.”
Becky Briesacher, a health services researcher and associate professor in Northeastern’s School of Pharmacy, said that she’s seen such arguments from the industry for as long as she’s been in the field.
“Their argument is if they don’t have a lot of money that they’ve made from past drugs, they’re not going to develop new drugs,” Briesacher said. “They have to have a lot of money so they can develop the new drugs of tomorrow. So what people say is, ‘But how much is that?’”
There is no denying that the pharmaceutical industry’s role in developing and improving drugs is crucial. The concern, however, is that the price tags on certain drugs do not always align with their actual value.
“Certain drugs deserve to be handsomely rewarded financially because they, for instance, might be extending the life of a patient with childhood leukemia for another eight to 10 years,” said David Whitrap, vice president of communications and outreach at the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review. “But far too often, there are drugs that are providing just very little additional benefit over what’s already on the market, but they’re priced with a major increase over what’s already on the market.” 
Another common argument against pharmaceutical companies’ claims that reduced profit would stunt innovation is that this money is largely channeled elsewhere. Whitrap said that the most recent data he had seen showed greater spending by these companies on marketing and advertising than on investment back into research and development.
“The pharmaceutical industry is super profitable, and they certainly do not take all of that money and put it back into research and development,” Briesacher said. “Then the argument is, how much profit should they be able to make, even while we still want them to be innovative?”
Parmet said this plan is not seeking to regulate prices, but rather to force drug manufacturers to justify them. The proposal, she said, is therefore more about “shining a light” on excessive pricing and “potentially shaming” drug manufacturers — which theoretically wouldn’t become an issue for them if their prices are truly justifiable.
Massachusetts is not the only state attempting to tackle this issue. Whitrap said the proposal looks similar to other states’ policies, referencing New York legislation passed two years ago that saved the state $175 million in the 2017-2018 fiscal year without having to limit patient access to any drugs.
“If those sort of savings are on the table here, that’s something that I think would definitely be of interest to Massachusetts policymakers and citizens,” Whitrap said.
However, some believe that the Baker administration may be overestimating cost savings with their proposal, but still maintain that the proposal would be effective in its goal.
“This huge number that the Baker administration is saying they could potentially save … is, some people think, unrealistic,” Briesacher said. “It’s more about just managing that it doesn’t keep getting more and more expensive, rather than just having this whole big pot of money that’s left over.”
Parmet stressed the importance of government taking action in an industry that she says has long gone unchecked.
“We need to understand that doing nothing isn’t working either, that this is a very complicated but very distorted marketplace and that the lack of intervention by the government is not working,” Parmet said. “I think it will be in the interest of the drug companies, actually, not only the patients, to negotiate in good faith and come up with something that can work for everybody.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57758/campus/elizabeth-warren-supports-nu-facultys-right-to-hold-unionization-election/,Elizabeth Warren supports NU faculty’s right to hold unionization election,"Christopher Butler, managing editor","February 13, 2019","While the debate continues among the full-time, non-tenure track faculty about whether or not to unionize, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to President Joseph E. Aoun on Dec. 20 in support of the faculty’s right to vote on unionization.
In a petition submitted to the National Labor Relations Board on Nov. 5, members of the full-time, non-tenure track faculty stated that they wanted to vote on whether or not to form a union. The university responded, saying the faculty are managers and not allowed to hold an election.
The faculty withdrew the petition, but are still advocating for the election. After the Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, reached out to Warren and explained the predicament, Warren sent a letter to Aoun urging the university to reconsider.
“The right of all workers to join a union, if they choose, is essential to ensuring that they have a place at the negotiating table and meaningful opportunity to improve their pay and working conditions,” she wrote in the public letter. “While members of the Northeastern community may disagree about whether these faculty members would be best served by unionizing, these workers alone should have the right to decide this question for themselves.”
While some full-time, non-tenure track faculty oppose unionizing, others say they should still be able to vote on the issue.
“If we have a vote and the vote is ‘no,’ I accept that, that’s the democratic process,” said Polly Attwood, a professor in the College of Professional Studies. “But if they deny the vote, we don’t get to have our democratic process.”
In an email sent on Jan. 8 from Senior Vice Provost for Academic Affairs Debra Franko, Franko said that unionizing would hurt the progress made under the university’s One Faculty model, an initiative aimed to ensure all full-time faculty are involved in university governance.
“This initiative has brought all faculty together and given everyone a stake in the university’s success,” Franko wrote in the email. “Whether you serve on a college committee, plan to represent your colleagues in the Faculty Senate or participate in college-wide votes, full-time faculty have partnered together to effect meaningful change.”
The email also said that a union could sacrifice the faculty’s direct voice to the university.
“Instead of shaping your path together with your colleagues through involvement in college governance and the Faculty Senate, union representation would supplant your independent voice,” Franko wrote in the email. “Your employment terms, and those of faculty across other departments and colleges, would be subject to union negotiations where the union bargaining team decides what to prioritize.”
The full-time, non-tenure track faculty plan to resubmit their petition in hopes to hold an election on the issue. SEIU staff and Northeastern faculty members held a demonstration in Centennial Common Feb. 6 as another push for support.
Chris ButlerNU faculty members hold signs in Centennial Common on Feb. 6 to push support for their right to hold an election.
“At the end of the day, whether people want a union or not, is up to the people,” said Peter MacKinnon, president of SEIU Local 509. “We just want that voice to be heard.”
Students and faculty chanted, “Let us vote” during the demonstration, and Northeastern faculty and SEIU officials gave speeches.
“Right now we’re just at a standstill,” said Somy Kim, a professor in the Department of English. “Now it’s just public pressure.”
The protest, along with Warren’s letter, aimed to show the support behind the union’s hopes to hold an election.
“Senator Warren believes we should have that process,” Attwood said. “The wider public community is watching Northeastern.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57752/city-pulse/wwii-era-duck-boats-carry-tourists-and-championship-teams-through-boston-alike/,WWII-era duck boats carry tourists and championship teams through Boston alike,"Paige Stern, news correspondent","February 13, 2019","Crafted to face battle, these amphibious vehicles once carried soldiers onto the shores of Normandy. Today, they carry tourists in cities across the nation, as well as the athletic champions of Boston. 
The duck boat tour phenomenon has played a major role in the tourism industry of several U.S. cities, including Boston, Philadelphia and San Diego. But this popular attraction was not originally created for its current use. 
The former model, the DUKW (D for model year 1942, U for amphibious utility vehicle, K for front-wheel drive, W for dual rear-axle), was built by General Motors about six months after the United States joined forces with the allies in World War II. 
The amphibious vehicle filled the need for dockless transportation of supplies from ships to shore. Made to carry two loads of cargo, 21,000 DUKWs carried 3 million tons of troops and equipment around Europe throughout the war, including into the Battle of Normandy. Soldiers had traditionally called these boats “ducks.”
After the war, many of the duck boats were sold or granted to enforcement units throughout the U.S., including the National Guard. And despite its renown for duck boat tours, Boston entered the game a little late. The trend launched in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, in 1946, and made its way to Boston 48 years later. 
Andy Wilson, the founder and former CEO of Boston Duck Tours, was exploring the country when he first encountered the duck boat in Tennessee. 
“When he came back to Boston, he thought of the idea of touring people around Boston and taking a splash in the Charles River,” said Boston Duck Tours historian and safety officer James Healy. 
When the company started in October 1994, Wilson only owned four DUKWs and had a staff of 15 employees, including four conductors, which the company has since dubbed “conDUCKtors.” 
Today, the company has 115 workers from the first day of spring through November and owns 28 amphibious vehicles that resemble the DUKW. Due to the high-maintenance demands of the original vehicles, they began to phase them out in 2006. It is estimated that 600,000 people ride with Boston Duck Tours annually. 
“Our primary goal is to educate,” Healy said. “We want people who come to Boston to leave with an appreciation for the city and what it has contributed, while doing it in a fun way.”
Boston Duck Tour company has done just that for many tourists.
“Being on the duck tour allowed me to hit all of the historical and modern locations of importance throughout the city in an easy and comfortable environment,” said Avi Carr-Gloth, 20. Currently a student at Emerson College, Carr-Gloth is originally from New York, and ‘played tourist’ while accompanying his campers on a field trip to Boston in the summer of 2016. “The driver was super nice and answered all of our questions. Getting to ride in the Charles was amazing as well.” 
What the Boston Duck Boats have been most noted for, carrying Boston’s athletic champions along their victory parade, only started in 2002 — the first time the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl. 
“The Patriots won and the mayor asked if the city could use our ducks to carry the team in the parade,” Healy said. “And of course, we said yes.” The Boston Duck Tour company has donated their vehicles to the city for every parade since — 12 in total, combining the Patriots, Red Sox, Bruins and Celtics triumphs.
Northeastern journalism Professor Charles Fountain, a self-described life-long New Englander, witnessed the incorporation of the duck boats into the parades of Boston’s champions. 
“Once you use the duck boats for the second parade, you were going to use them for every parade,” Fountain said. He also recalled that the parades last featured a dip into the Charles River during the Red Sox World Series victory route in 2013. “The duck boats have become a national symbol because there’s so many of them [parades].” 
In Boston, duck boats are more than a tourist attraction. They are a piece of this nation’s past, a symbol of victory, and to many, an important part of the place they call home."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57747/lifestyle/review-the-21st-century-version-of-my-fair-lady-empowers-audiences/,Review: The 21st century version of ‘My Fair Lady’ empowers audiences,"Lucy Hoffman, news correspondent","February 13, 2019","Anyone entering the Central Square Theater to see Bedlam’s “Pygmalion” with expectations of Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison singing and walking off into the sunshine together is in for a surprise.
“Pygmalion” is the original play by George Bernard Shaw that was adapted into the movie and musical “My Fair Lady.” The shows contain the same basic storyline: A poor girl named Eliza Doolittle selling flowers on the street falls into the hands of a linguist, Henry Higgins, who decides to teach her how to be a lady in high society. The endings, however, could not be more different.
The play is named for the ancient Greek character Pygmalion who, according to myth, made a sculpture of his ideal woman. He then fell in love with his creation, which eventually came to life.
According to its website, the theater company Bedlam emphasizes “the immediacy of the relationship between the actor and the audience.” Its interpretation of “Pygmalion” manipulates the production as an interactive experience, giving the audience a deeper connection to the characters and the performance as a whole.
The show opens in an atypical manner, with cast members and stage crew asking audience members to join them onstage and mill about to “fill the space.” Then, in flash mob style, the actors begin their performance, still surrounded by the surprised audience.
The company also provides an interesting interpretation of the story for those accustomed to the Hollywood version. Missing from the performance are some of the iconic scenes — Doolittle studying language and fooling the upper class into thinking she is one of them at a party, not to mention returning to Higgins in the end.  
These omissions suggest that the important part of the story is the relationship unfolding between Doolittle and Higgins. This telling centers around Doolittle’s internal development, not her superficial external development.
Bedlam replaces these scenes with ones that convey Doolittle’s transformation. In the middle of the show, Vaishnavi Sharma as Doolittle performs a solo scene putting on a dress. Soft, dramatic music plays as she changes, her outer metamorphosis mirroring the inner. Scenes like this allow the audience to gain a deeper understanding of her development.
In Shaw’s original story, Doolittle displays her independence at the end of the show. She may be in love with Higgins, but she isn’t going to run back to him if he isn’t willing to treat her the way she knows she deserves. He claims that she shouldn’t be upset because he treats her the same way he treats everyone else — but Doolittle, a strong, intelligent woman, knows that someone who truly cared about her wouldn’t be so selfish.
In 1914, when “Pygmalion” first opened, audiences weren’t quite ready for this level of female independence. A woman didn’t even have the right to vote, so why should she have the right to leave the man who loved her — even if he didn’t treat her well?
In 2019, it’s a different story. As wholesome and fulfilling as a fairytale ending can be, this show brings something more: empowerment. It acknowledges the fact that a woman does not need to crawl back to someone who tells her he won’t change for her, who won’t even admit he loves her. She is completely free from any obligation to fix him or love him despite his flaws.  In the end, Doolittle walks off into the sunshine all by herself.
“Pygmalion” is at the Central Square Theater in Cambridge through March 3."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57589/campus/printing-press-from-1896-installed-in-holmes-hall/,Printing press from 1896 installed in Holmes Hall,"Alyssa Lukpat, news correspondent","February 13, 2019","The English department installed a 19th-century platinum printing press last month in Holmes Hall. 
The printer, located in the Huskiana Press printing studio in Holmes 489, was built in Boston in 1896, said Ryan Cordell, an associate English professor at Northeastern. An operator can print text by arranging metal letters in a tray, placing ink on the printer and pumping a lever. Cordell, the director of Huskiana Press, hopes the new printer will teach the Northeastern community about modern and vintage printing methods.
“This printer is a way of connecting with the history of textual production,” he said. “It shows the relationship with contemporary and historical technology, like 3D printers that can create image blocks to use for printing.”
Cordell is especially interested in exploring how to combine 3D printing with historical printing technology. Cordell will use the printer, a Golding Pearl #14 model, to teach his English students about book history. Ultimately, he hopes people will learn how to operate the labor-intensive printer.
“Once we have a community working in press, we’re hoping we’ll have hours where people can come in,” Cordell said.
David Medina, a third-year doctoral candidate studying English, helped set up the printing press, which was assembled by the Museum of Printing in Haverhill, Massachusetts. He said the printer will interest anyone who wants to explore older technologies.
“We’ve been disconnected, I feel, from the technologies we now consider antiquated,” Medina said. “Now there’s a revival, reexamination and re-imagination of what these technologies do and what they’re like.”
Ivy Pepin, a fifth-year English major, came to the Huskiana studio to see a historical printing press in action.
“[This is] something I’ve wanted to learn for a long time,” she said. “It represents a nice move toward slower methods of creating things and slower thinking.”
Muhammad ElarbiRyan Cordell, the director of Huskiana Press, shows off the printing press Feb. 12.
The studio is hosting printing workshops for people who are interested in learning more about the printer. The studio and workshops are open to the Northeastern community, and Cordell said anyone is welcome to learn more about the printer.
“We’re trying to build community in this space,” Cordell said. “It’s doesn’t matter if you’re an English major or you don’t think you know about printers.”
Though Medina has conducted research about book history, he was surprised by how much labor and ink the printer needs for a small pamphlet. He said the printing press has changed the way he approaches his English research.
“This is a new thing for Northeastern, but it’s more than an exciting piece of technology,” Medina said. “It’s something that’ll fundamentally change the way we think about things we take for granted, like communication and preserving information.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57728/campus/student-gun-control-advocates-take-stock-a-year-after-parkland-shooting/,Activists take stock a year after Parkland shooting,"Melissa Wells, news staff","February 12, 2019","At the forefront of the grassroots movement for stronger gun control started in 2018 were students like Leslie Chiu, a Floridian who graduated from NU last December with a degree in accounting and marketing. She doesn’t forget her impromptu start in activism around this time last year, which resulted in her becoming a co-organizer of the March For Our Lives Boston.
“I didn’t go into it thinking I was going to be said activist. It just happened, organically,” Chiu said. “I have a personal connection to what happened in Parkland and I wanted to be involved and do my part. It just kind of turned out that I became one of the co-organizers. What happened more than hits home, it was home — is home, so I just felt like I did what I had to do to protect that.”
Chiu was one of many Northeastern students motivated by the Parkland shooting and the subsequent March For Our Lives movement, either as activists or politically active citizens, but all as voters. 
The victories achieved by the movement are worth celebrating to these students, but they acknowledge the momentum garnered by the gun control movement has yet to create significant legislative impact on gun violence in the United States. 
Catherine Wenger is a second-year pre-med student at Northeastern majoring in international affairs. Originally from Pennsylvania, her political involvement stems from issues she is passionate about, including health care and gun control. She said she believes change on the national level will be slow, no matter what activists do.
“I think it’s going to take a long time for things to really start moving, but I think that it’s definitely headed in the right direction,” Wenger said. “There’s still the whole polarity of politics right now that is slowing everything down, but it will eventually make an impact.”
Wenger wasn’t directly involved with the March For Our Lives events, but supported the message and cast her vote with the issue of gun violence in mind during the midterm elections.
This is demonstrative of one of the biggest changes the students observe as a result of the movement, evident in the 2018 midterm elections — the rise in politically active youth. 
According to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, or CIRCLE, political engagement among the youth demographic ages 18-29 was among the highest in a midterm election in decades. In 2018, it is estimated that 31 percent of youth voted, up 10 percentage points since the 2014 election. Furthermore, a CIRCLE pre-election survey of youth revealed “the percentage of youth who have participated in a protest [tripled] in just the last two years.”
But with political engagement must come education, Chiu said. This is something that she said the March For Our Lives movement tried to tackle as well — a lack of awareness. 
“I don’t believe change can happen if you stay ignorant,” Chiu said. “I think young people all over need to try and educate themselves, in a literal sense and figuratively.” 
Beca Muñoz, a third-year politics, philosophy and economics major, is remembered by many for her joint speech at the March 24, 2018 March For Our Lives Boston with her younger sister, Leonor Muñoz, a senior from Stoneman Douglas High School who survived the shooting. A Parkland native like Chiu, Muñoz agreed that political awareness is key.
File photo by Dylan ShenProtesters in Washington D.C. participate in the March for Our Lives, a student-led demonstration.
“Young people, historically, have been the greatest pushes for change and progress,” Muñoz said. “Young people should be informed when they’re at the forefront of our politics, especially when our House of Representatives is not representative of our country, which should be very alarming to everyone.”
Muñoz added that increased voter turnout can be traced back to the movement, as can recent Democratic successes. 
“We had a lot of amazing women of color and progressive candidates in a lot of swing states [in 2018]. People showed up,” Muñoz said. “A lot of progress has been made because people sense the urgency in this political climate and the need for young people to take their seats in politics at the local, state and federal level.”
In fact, the number of women elected into the House of Representatives was record-breaking, according to an NPR report, and overwhelmingly Democratic. Of 98 women elected to the House, 85 were Democrats. 
Furthermore, Congress now includes a record number of women of color, not to mention the first Muslim women and the youngest woman ever elected.
Wenger added a lot of progress has also been made through gun control advocacy, which the movement has promoted.
According to The Pew Charitable Trust Stateline Legislative Review of 2018, 50 new gun-restrictive laws have been enacted in 25 states all over America, including in 14 states with Republican governors. 
But according to experts like James Alan Fox, this impact has not extended to the major legislative change that would have a significant impact on gun violence. 
As a professor of criminology, law and public policy at Northeastern, Fox is known for his research on mass murder, school shootings and gun violence. He isn’t as idealistic as the Northeastern students. 
“We are seeing very little change and the change that we are seeing is not fundamental,” Fox said. “For example, banning bump stocks. They’ve been used in one mass killing, but that’s it. The changes that we’re seeing are at the margins.”
Chiu isn’t disillusioned by the lack of legislative change at the federal level.
As she leaves Northeastern behind, Chiu said that reminiscing on her activism, the movement’s success and the work left to accomplish is invigorating. 
“I think, just in general, it has really empowered our youth to show them that they do have a voice and they can make change,” she said. “I think that’s the most beautiful thing that we’ve created.”"

After mounting some early pressure on the Huskies, BC nabbed the first goal thanks to star defender Megan Keller. Keller, Hockey East’s reigning player of the week, took a pass from Kali Flanagan and ripped a wrister past NU goalie Aerin Frankel at the left pipe to make it 1-0 BC early.
The Huskies (21-4-4, 19-2-2 Hockey East) looked to strike back quickly, and had some promising looks on the power play soon after the goal. BC (21-10, 17-7 Hockey East) managed to kill off the penalty, but the Huskies got their best chance after the sides went back even. An NU shot rebounded off BC goalie Maddy McArthur and looked to be sliding toward the goal, but it was cleared off the line by Makenna Newkirk.
The Huskies got another great chance on another power play late in the period, when sophomore forward Veronika Pettey’s shot whipped off the iron and out as Northeastern continued to press. As that power play was ending, Andrea Renner redirected a Skylar Fontaine shot toward the goal, but it was saved brilliantly by McArthur.
At the end of the first, BC led 1-0. Northeastern managed 16 shots on goal, but McArthur was equal to all of them, while Frankel stopped 13 of BC’s 14 shots.
The second period started with NU supplying all the pressure, and eventually Pettey broke through for the tying goal. Two seconds after BC killed off a penalty, Pettey was on hand to tap the puck in after Alina Mueller’s shot was saved.
Pettey’s goal was her 15th of the year, and it looked to strike some life into Northeastern.
BC didn’t wait long to take the lead back though, scoring 1:23 after Pettey equalized. Attacking on the power play, Daryl Watts took a pass from Newkirk on the left wing and had plenty of time to line up a shot. She sniped the top corner with a wrist shot, leaving Frankel rooted to the spot and giving her side the 2-1 advantage.
By the end of the second, both teams had racked up massive amounts of shots, with BC edging NU 30 to 27. Despite having seven power-play opportunities in the first two periods, the Huskies failed to capitalize on any of the BC penalties. BC, meanwhile, struck with a goal on one of its three power plays.
Early in the third BC scored its third, from Kelly Browne. The forward fired it past Frankel after receiving a centering pass from Ryan Little (Little’s second assist of the night).
BC got its fourth tally at 8:27 of the third as Watts struck for her second of the game. Skating down the right wing, Watts had space to take a wrister which she placed past Frankel at the far post.
With about eight minutes left, the Huskies had two good chances to get back into the game through Kasidy Anderson. Her first shot was saved by McArthur before her backhand follow-up missed the net with McArthur out of position.
Aerin Frankel stopped 43 shots for NU, but BC’s attack proved too much as Watts caused them problems all night long with 12 shots on net and two goals.
“I thought it was a pretty good game through two periods and got away from us a little bit in the third,” head coach Dave Flint said. “It felt like we didn’t capitalize on our power-play opportunities, which was a big part of it. I felt like if we could have capitalized on a few of those, it could’ve been a different game.”
A major storyline was the Huskies’ inability to score on the power play — they went 0-8 with the advantage.
“In the second period when we had a bunch of power plays right in a row, we had a couple, we just fanned on the puck or just missed it, we just missed on connecting,” Flint said. “So I think it was a little bit of puck luck, and you know they played hard and they did a good job on the PK, and it just wasn’t working for us today.”
The Huskies will look to regroup when they travel to Providence on Saturday, and then host the Friars at Matthews Arena Sunday. A point from either of those games would clinch the regular season Hockey East title for Northeastern, as they clinched a share of it last weekend against Merrimack."

We need a food system that increases affordability for students.
Northeastern offers three meal plans to students living on campus without a kitchen: 10, 15 or 19 meals per week. Students living in residence halls, International Village for example, must purchase at least the 10-meal-per-week plan. These plans cost $3,175, $3,665, and $3,970 per semester respectively. Northeastern’s fall semester runs for 15 weeks. These are steep rates even for eating out.
Worse yet, meal plans do not roll over from week to week. As of last year, the only way to get rid of unused swipes at the end of the week was to go to Outtakes, which offers a selection of snacks, drinks and pre-made meals from the dining hall.
Many dining halls across the country are expensive, but Northeastern’s meal plans are exceptionally pricey. For example, Boston College uses a mandatory unlimited meal plan system that costs freshmen $2,709 per semester, several hundred dollars cheaper than Northeastern’s plans.

There are several ways Northeastern could fix its dining system.
For one, it is absurd that students are forced to spend at least $3,175 per semester on food when many cheaper and likely preferable dining options are located within several hundred feet of most dorms. Qdoba, Amelia’s and Boston Shawarma are a couple minutes’ walk from several freshman residence halls.
Another good step would be lowering the cost of meal swipes. In a 2017 article, Money.com pointed out that labor and repair costs contribute to the high price of meal plans. Dining service providers must pay for staff wages and facility upgrades and repairs. These costs are integrated into the price of each meal. In theory, Chartwells, Northeastern’s dining service provider, should have slightly increased the price of each meal to account for the increased pay of the dining hall workers announced last year. But meal plan prices have not changed, indicating that meal prices are not dependent on workers’ wages.
Northeastern could also offer meal plans on a semesterly or yearly basis, instead of weekly. In these plans, students would be allotted a certain number of swipes per semester and could use their meals when they feel like it. This system eliminates the penalty for forgetting to use remaining swipes before the end of the week.
Last year, SGA and Northeastern attempted to patch up the university’s meal plan system with Swipe2Care. Swipe2Care is a mechanism that allows students to donate unused meal swipes to their peers who may not be able to afford enough meals. It’s not clear who does or doesn’t qualify to request meal swipes. 
Initially, I loved the idea of Swipe2Care, but the more I understand how it works, the more it seems to entirely misdiagnose the problem with our food system. At its core, Swipe2Care allows Northeastern’s administration to push the burden of making meal plans more flexible and affordable onto students instead of just offering better plans. I hope Swipe2Care is a temporary fix, not a long-term solution.
It does not bother me that the university is utilizing its dining halls to yield a profit. It bothers me that the administration is using Swipe2Care to make the dining halls seem more affordable.
Moving forward, meal plan prices will likely increase. According to NU Dining, meal plan prices typically increase 3 percent annually. Since 2010, inflation has averaged about 1.7 percent, meaning Northeastern’s meal plans should have increased by 11.7 percent since 2010. This is not the case. Meal plans all increased by more than 11.7 percent in this time span.
In other words, in 2018 and 2019 Northeastern students pay between 15 and 19 percent more for meal plans than Northeastern students did in 2010. 
Northeastern has not offered cheaper or more flexible plans because it has consistently profited from the current system with little demand for a new setup. Swipe2Care is not a solution to expensive meal plans."

https://huntnewsnu.com/57600/sports/beanpot-champs-again-nu-seniors-get-a-lasting-memory/,"Beanpot champs again, NU seniors get a lasting memory",Mike Puzzanghera and Sofie Kato,"February 12, 2019","After a phenomenal performance from his classmates, senior captain Eric Williams thrust the Beanpot trophy into the air in celebration and was swarmed by his fellow Huskies. Williams and his fellow seniors exited their final Beanpot with a second-straight trophy.
One look at NU’s attacking lines makes it evident how important the seniors are to this team. There are five senior Husky forwards who played tonight, and one defenseman: Patrick Schule, Brandon Hawkins, Liam Pecararo, Lincoln Griffin, Austin Plevy and Williams. Together, they scored three goals and three assists Monday against BC.
“The senior leadership and the older guys were really good on the bench and Cayden Primeau I thought was just outstanding tonight and was deserving of the awards that he got,” head coach Jim Madigan said.
Plevy was the first to strike for Northeastern in the first period. After a wraparound attempt from Griffin was saved by BC goalie Joseph Woll, the rebound lingered in front of the net and Plevy was able to jab his stick into the scrum. Woll lost control of the puck and Plevy found the space he needed to get the final touch and the opening goal.
A native of British Columbia, Plevy’s goal Monday was his third of the year. Despite being a senior, this is his first year with the Huskies after he spent three seasons at UMass. His goal tonight disrupts his visually-pleasing career line. Before Monday, he was sitting on 22-33-55.
“He had a lot of blocked shots today, too,” Madigan said. “I think he had three … and that was a huge goal. We needed that. At the doorfront, that’s where he scores, he’s in tight, got a good stick. We needed to get that first goal.”
Next to contribute was Schule, who netted his second goal of the tournament. After Matt Thomson went behind the net to find Schule with a pass in the slot, the senior still had plenty of work to do. He got remarkable power on his wrister, which beat Woll at his near post and left the keeper stunned. Schule skated away and slid into his trademark archer celebration, firing his imaginary arrow up into the stands to uproarious cheers.
Schule’s goal was his ninth of the year, and he’s made his impact felt at NU in his 95 career games.
“His consistency has been really good all year long,” Madigan said. “He’s had a lot of looks also and he’s worked his tail off. He has made the most of his senior year and has contributed tremendously to our team. He gets a goal here tonight, and Lincoln Griffin gets a goal, those are two big seniors who have worked really hard for this program.”
Griffin got the third goal, which put NU up 3-0 in the third, to go with his assist on Plevy’s score. The forward found a loose puck after Pecararo’s shot was saved by Woll. He skated in between the circles and flicked the puck over Woll as the BC keeper lay on the ground, and the Huskies had their third.
Riley RobinsonLincoln Griffin, a senior forward, is all smiles after winning the second Beanpot title of his NU career.
Pecararo had the assist for Griffin’s goal, and was a constant threat throughout the game. The forward was strong going forward on the rush, and he supplied two shots on goal to keep pressure on Woll.
Pecararo has had a solid year for the Huskies with six goals and now 11 assists. His career numbers are low with only 26 total points, but his contributions to the team this season have been vital.
Hawkins was thorn in the side of BC throughout the game. Though the forward did not register a point, he totaled four shots on goal and seven attempts in the game. He has 22 points on the season, tied for the team lead.
The final goal came from sophomore Zach Solow, after some clever work from Griffin once again. After Matt Filipe broke forward toward an empty net, he pinned the puck against the boards to waste some time before the puck came out to Griffin. Griffin found Solow, and he made no mistake. The three forwards raced together towards the corner and leaped against the glass in celebration as the Huskies wrapped up their second straight title.
Griffin’s performance was one to remember. The forward scored one, helped on two, registered six shots on goal and blocked two BC shots. The showing brings him up to 15 points on the year, and 48 for his career. One of his two blocks came on a big BC chance late in the game, and it gave the Huskies a little extra boost.
“Someone talked about the blocked shots and I think [Griffin] led the way in blocking shots,” Madigan said. “Second effort, down low in our d-zone, things that don’t show up on the scoresheet, he was really good.
“When you get a big blocked shot, you can hear the bench. It creates momentum for your team, and there’s times where you need momentum, and a big blocked shot will provide that, just like an O-zone play, that blocked shot is key, and he did that for us.”
Captain Williams added a block in the defense, but his biggest contribution to the team was his leadership. The defenseman has had 11 points this year on three goals and eight assists, and he supplies help for the rest of the team both on and off the ice.
“It’s an amazing feeling and something none of us are ever going to forget,” Williams said of winning in his last year. “I wish I could play in this tournament every year until the day I die.”
Madigan won the tournament twice during his playing days at Northeastern, including in his senior year. While he will lose many valuable players from his team at the end of the season, he knows that they won’t lose this moment.
“I was fortunate to win this event as a senior, and you remember it a little bit more than if you were a freshman or sophomore or junior,” Madigan said. “So for those guys who are graduating, it’s a special, special feeling.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57597/sports/nu-outlasts-bc-to-win-second-consecutive-beanpot/,NU outlasts BC to win second consecutive Beanpot,"Marisa Goolgasian, news staff","February 12, 2019","The DogHouse, spanning about 10 sections of TD Garden’s balcony, erupted as Northeastern captain Eric Williams triumphantly hoisted the iconic Beanpot trophy into the air for the second year Monday night. The Huskies beat Boston College, 4-2, for their second consecutive tournament win and sixth overall.
“It’s incredible. It’s such a great feeling, to get a win in my last Beanpot tournament, but I’m also extremely happy for the freshmen who haven’t experienced this feeling yet,” Williams said. “It’s an amazing feeling and something none of us are ever going to forget.
“I wish I could play in this tournament every year until the day I die.”
Four different Huskies scored: Austin Plevy, Lincoln Griffin, Patrick Schule and Zach Solow. Cayden Primeau got the win in net saving 33 of 35 shots.
This championship victory over the Eagles proved the Beanpot drought that plagued the Huskies for 30 years prior to the 2018 tournament is not likely to return any time soon. This win made the Huskies the first team in five years to win the tournament in back-to-back years and the second Northeastern team in tournament history to do so.
There were excellent opportunities on both sides throughout the first period. Northeastern’s offense was aggressive from the start, outshooting BC in the first and scoring the first goal of the game with under a minute left in the period, a greasy punch-in goal at the crease scored by the senior forward Plevy. Early in the period, BC appeared to score the first goal, but it was determined that the puck didn’t go in before the net was dislodged, allowing NU to get the game’s first goal.
The Huskies outshot the Eagles again in the second period, this time 12-8. Northeastern remained aggressive throughout the middle frame, holding back BC and finally putting another goal on the board at 17:54 when senior forward Schule ripped a shot into the left corner of the net off a pass from freshman forward Matt Thompson from behind the net. 
The score quickly improved to 3-0 early in the third when Griffin scored at 1:25 off of a rebound from a blocked shot from senior forward Liam Pecararo. At this point the Huskies may have started to become complacent, and BC’s desperation started to yield results. 
The Eagles scored twice in 6 minutes, one at 4:09 from junior forward David Cotton and one at 12:14 from senior forward JD Dudek. The Huskies, forced to refocus and ramp their efforts back up, fought hard until the end, when sophomore forward Zach Solow scored on an empty net with less than six seconds to go, bringing the final score to 4-2.
Goaltending was impressive on both ends tonight but NU sophomore tender Cayden Primeau stood out, saving 33 of 35 shots in the game. This stellar performance earned Primeau not only the Eberly Award for the tournament’s top goalie, but the MVP award as well. 
“He was unbelievable tonight and last week,” Williams said of Primeau. “We don’t win this tournament without him. He gives our team so much confidence … He bailed us out several times tonight.”
After a generation of NU fans grew up without seeing a Beanpot victory, Primeau has played at the school for two years without knowing a loss."

https://huntnewsnu.com/57584/sports/womens-basketball-gets-revenge-against-towson/,Women’s basketball gets revenge against Towson,"Vincent van Oorschot, news staff","February 11, 2019","Northeastern’s clutch shooting and strong second quarter was responsible for their 77-68 win over Towson Sunday afternoon at Cabot Center.
The day began in high spirits as both Gabby Giacone and Jess Genco received awards for their efforts in recent games. Senior guard Genco was recognized for becoming the Huskies’ all-time assists leader with 499. Giacone, a senior forward, was celebrated for her 1,000th point, which she gained two weeks prior against Charleston.
Northeastern (15-7, 5-6 CAA) got out of the blocks early, opening the game leading 9-3. However, Towson (13-9, 7-4 CAA) managed to contain the early onslaught through a strong defensive effort from their forwards. 
Last time out in Towson, the Tigers out-blocked the Huskies 12-1, and the opening period in Sunday’s matchup showed a similar pattern, as the visiting team rejected seven of Northeastern’s attempts, with three blocks from senior center Maia Lee.
With sophomore guard Stella Clark leading the opening quarter in scoring for Northeastern with five, the Huskies held a slim lead at the first break, 17-16.
Back-to-back 3s from Genco and freshman guard Kendall Currence broke the lead open for Northeastern, showing the style of play that has been lacking of late. This deadeye display of shooting from distance propelled the home team to a 10-0 run, extending its lead to 13.
“I just try to focus on what I have to do,” Currence said post game. “I get my momentum from my defense, and when that starts to go, my offense starts to go too.”
Northeastern’s 39-29 lead at the end of the first half was aided by Genco’s 12 points and 10 points off the bench from Currence, each with two 3-pointers apiece. Giacone also assisted on the boards with six rebounds to go along with her eight first half points.
The Huskies were able to keep the Tigers at bay for the majority of the second half and were on track to redeem themselves after losing to the same team back in January. But halfway through the fourth quarter, Towson went on an 8-0 run to cut the lead down to five at 73-68 with only two minutes remaining. 
After Genco fouled out with 2:30 left in the game, it came down to her teammates to take the contest home, and thanks to clutch free throws from freshman guard Katie May and junior forward Ayanna Dublin, the Huskies put the game beyond doubt with the 77-68 win.
“We still have a lot of growing to do as a group,” head coach Kelly Cole said. “We had freshmen doing great things tonight, and we’ll be in contention when we get everybody scoring as we did tonight.”
The win puts the Huskies at 5-6 in conference play and places them in the sixth seed in the CAA heading into the team’s next road trip, where they’ll clash with fifth-placed Delaware (10-12, 5-5 CAA) and second-placed Drexel (16-5, 8-2 CAA)."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57581/campus/journalist-april-ryan-speaks-at-nu-on-covering-the-trump-white-house/,Journalist April Ryan speaks at NU on covering the Trump White House,"Yunkyo Kim, news staff","February 10, 2019","Journalist and political analyst April Ryan talked about her experience as a black reporter in the current White House when she came to Blackman Auditorium Friday as a Winter Gateway Series speaker. Ryan discussed her new book, “Under Fire: Reporting from the Front Lines of the Trump White House” with moderator and NBC Boston news anchor Latoyia Edwards before heading to a signing in Gallery 360. 
“I’ve been here 22 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this before. Presidents and their press secretaries don’t always like what the reporters ask … but there’s decorum,” Ryan said during the event. “It is a sad day that any reporter has to ask a sitting United States president if [he is] racist.”
The annual Winter Gateway Series is an effort by Northeastern Crossing, a cross-departmental initiative that seeks to improve neighborhood relations through meet-and-greets, local artist exhibitions, gateway mixers and more. The program is in its third year, and last year hosted Black Lives Matter founder Shaun King as the speaker. 
Ryan had sharp criticisms for President Donald J. Trump. “Under Fire” narrates the backlash Ryan received from the executive office for her direct line of questioning toward the president. 
“You don’t tell a reporter what they can or cannot ask,” Ryan said. “[The administration] has tried to dig up information on me. I am boring. They try to smear me, but they can’t. You see what’s going up with Jeff Bezos. They can blackmail you … But you know what? You call them out. And what’s what this book is about.”
Rebecca Riccio, director of the Social Impact Lab — a co-sponsor organization of the event — praised Ryan’s resilience.
“I think it’s so important for people like April to stand up and demonstrate what it means to maintain courage, integrity and truth,” Riccio said. “You might think that because she’s a journalist, she has tough skin or that she’s signed up for the kind of abuse that she’s received, and that’s really not the case.”
Ryan’s words resonated with community members in attendance. Roxbury resident and NU alum Elizabeth Nagarajah, 52, said the conversation gave her more insight into the Trump presidency, partisan politics and the modern press. 
“I think [the president] definitely has an agenda about who he wants to answer,” Nagarajah said. “Saying that all news is fake news if it’s not coming from the source that he wants, it’s going to be a challenge, and the more he continues to promote that, it’s not going to get better.” 
Mia Vuckovich, a first-year political science major, said it is crucial for the NU community to protect the press. 
“As for freedom of the press, in today’s political climate, it’s something that we’re not always entirely sure about,” Vuckovich said. “I hope that we, on a school level and the local level, can work to make sure that those institutions are protected and that that effect can be conveyed on the national level.” 
In addition to her account of reporting on the White House through four presidencies, Ryan expressed hope for the future. She said the current administration became the impetus for many minorities to run as Democratic contenders in 2020, and hinted at upcoming candidacy announcements from some members of the Obama cabinet. 
“I know it’s crazy. Look, we’ve got like five thousand people who are already on the stage. But it’s a beautiful thing,” she said. “The diversity, the women who believe they can run for president, all the different colors of the rainbow, the stories behind them — it’s no longer a white male-dominated game. We the people are joining in. But now, we are going to figure out who that one person is going to be.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57578/sports/mens-basketball-holds-elon-scoreless-in-overtime-wins-4th-in-a-row/,"Men’s basketball holds Elon scoreless in overtime, wins 4th in a row","Seamus McAvoy, news staff","February 9, 2019","It took an overtime period for Northeastern to topple Elon in their first meeting of the season, and once again the the Huskies needed an extra five minutes to pull away. The Huskies dominated in overtime yet again, and took the game 72-60. They held Elon scoreless in the extra period.
The Huskies (15-9, 9-3 CAA) got things started with a designed play for junior guard Jordan Roland, who knocked down an open corner three off a baseline screen. The Phoenix (8-18, 4-9 CAA) answered with a three of their own, and the teams continued trading baskets for much of the first half. Roland and senior guard Vasa Pusica ran the show early on, accounting for Northeastern’s first 16 points with eight apiece. 
A strong finish from sophomore forward Tomas Murphy earned Northeastern its first points from a player not named Pusica or Roland, but the Huskies trailed 23-22 even after five consecutive made field goals with 8:13 remaining in the half. 
After trading buckets, the two teams then traded droughts. Elon went cold from the field and the opportunistic Huskies took full advantage — junior guard Bolden Brace knocked down a transition 3, Roland hit a stepback jumper from behind the arc, and the Huskies established a 34-24 lead with 3:45 left in the half behind a 16-4 run. 
After Brace got a layup to go, Northeastern fell into a cold spell of its own. Elon broke off an 11-0 run to close out the opening period, taking a 35-34 lead into the half. 
After a rough end to the first half for the Huskies, head coach Bill Coen probably would have hoped for a better start to the second as Northeastern failed to score on its first four possessions of the period. Elon clearly made it a point of emphasis to take away the baseline screen action that got Roland open for the first points of the game, and the Huskies were searching for answers offensively. 
Brace was once again the answer, converting on a nice layup and feeding a perfectly placed pass to Murphy for the easy finish on the following possession. Roland capped off the run by proving that he’s more than just a 3-point marksman — he blew by his man with a quick first step to get to the rim and posterized the defender, albeit with some help from the rim, and Northeastern took a 41-37 lead after Roland got an and-one to go. 
Before heating up late in the half, Elon was marred by a 1-10 shooting stretch. A Pusica 3-pointer capped off an 8-0 run for Northeastern over that time, and the Huskies held a 52-44 lead at the under-eight media timeout. 
Elon then got a huge boost off the bench from guard Sheldon Eberhardt and forward Federico Poser, who would combine for 22 on the night, and the Phoenix managed to claw their way back into the game. A layup from Santa Ana tied the game at 60-all with 1:57 remaining, and neither team managed to score the decisive basket as time expired. 
Once in overtime, the Huskies looked like a different team. Brace was especially lethal, connecting on back-to-back corner threes and draining both free throws when fouled in transition. He was responsible for eight of Northeastern’s 12 points in the overtime period, and finished the night with 20 on 7-13 shooting to go with 14 rebounds. 
“It’s tough when we go into overtime in a game like that because they kind of made a push at the end, and at the end of the first half too,” Brace said. “I wasn’t really nervous, but there’s always jitters going into overtime because you don’t know what’s going to happen.”
Brace was also pivotal to the defensive effort. With freshman Jason Strong, Brace limited forward Tyler Seibring to just 1-17 shooting from the field. Seibring, Elon’s leading scorer, had been averaging 16.9 coming into the game. 
“I think one of the biggest things was we had a really good walkthrough today,” Brace said. “The coaches put together some really good film, and we kind of knew what they were going to run.”
Coach Coen also lauded Seibring’s talent after the game, in spite of the off-night. “[Seibring’s] a terrific player,” he said. ”He didn’t shoot the ball well tonight… but he’s an inside-outside guy, can take you off the dribble, he’s a tough matchup.”
In a game of runs, the Huskies put together their best stretch at the most important time. They didn’t allow Elon to score a single point in the overtime period, and took the game 72-60 after the extra five minutes. Pusica led all scorers with 23 on 7-13 shooting, and Roland added 21 on 7-17 shooting. 
“I thought we were very fortunate to earn a victory today,” Coen said. “We faced a really scrappy team… and we needed every effort.” 
WIth the victory, Northeastern stays put at second in the conference with a record of 15-9 (9-3 CAA). The Huskies travel to UNCW (8-17, 4-8 CAA) next Thursday as they continue conference play."

Northeastern (14-7, 4-6 CAA) and JMU (17-4, 9-1 CAA) began the matchup in a stalemate, with both squads unable to find the basket in the opening period thanks to tremendous defense from both sides,  headlined by a battle between Husky and Duke centers Gabby Giacone and Kayla Cooper-Williams.
Getting out of the blocks has proved to be a bit of a challenge for JMU. Last week they only scored nine points in their first quarter against Towson, but still earned the overtime win in the end. 
Northeastern’s defense proved itself in the opening 10 minutes of the game, keeping junior guard and CAA player-of-the-year candidate Kamiah Smalls to just two opening-quarter points.
The second quarter evidenced the Huskies’ inability to play four quarters straight, as the Dukes outscored Northeastern 23-8 in the quarter, including a 12-0 run which extended their lead to 13. 
“We forced them to put the ball on the floor,” NU head coach Kelly Cole said post-game. “Unfortunately, we let a bunch of the details slip in the second quarter and we had to play catch-up.”
Uncharacteristic scoring fell onto both teams, with Northeastern only managing to hit 25 percent from the field in the first half and senior guard Jess Genco being held scoreless to round out the Huskies’ low-scoring opening half. 
James Madison was able to continue the momentum into the third and maintain its lead, and with Smalls and junior guards Lexie Barrier and Jackie Benitez adding to the scoring contributions, they were able to keep the Huskies at arm’s length.
But with Genco knocking down her first points of the game halfway through the third quarter, the Huskies began to claw at the deficit, outscoring the Dukes 16-12 in the period and trailing at the end of three, 45-33.
Key 3s knocked down with five and three minutes left by Genco, her second and third of the contest, cut the Dukes’ lead down to 4, but JMU survived the late charge from Northeastern, further asserting themselves as the CAA’s top contender.
Northeastern takes on Towson (13-8, 7-3 CAA) on Sunday afternoon, seeking revenge against the Tigers for last time the two teams met. 
“For us, again as usual it’s about moving the ball,” Cole said of the Towson matchup. “We gave them 88 points [last time out], so for us it’s gonna be a defensive thing, and if we can hold JMU to 58 points then we should be able to hold anyone to 58 points.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57573/sports/womens-hockey-gets-12th-straight-home-win-over-merrimack/,Women’s hockey gets 12th straight home win over Merrimack,"Mike Puzzanghera, sports editor","February 8, 2019","Northeastern rebounded from a heartbreaking shootout loss against Boston University in the Beanpot in a big way, getting six goals from six different scorers across all four lines of attack to beat Merrimack 6-2 Friday night, clinching a share of the Hockey East regular season title in the process.
The Huskies (21-3-4, 19-2-2 Hockey East) welcomed the Warriors (14-10-5, 10-9-3 Hockey East) to Matthews Arena as they faced off for the first time this season. NU came in as the top team in the conference, sitting on 38 points for the season, 15 points ahead of Merrimack in fifth.
NU came in on an 11-game win streak at Matthews. After losing their first home game of the season to Colgate, they have not lost on their home ice.
An early penalty on sophomore defender Brooke Hobson meant the Warriors had free reign in the attacking zone for the first few minutes of the game. But despite playing 5-on-4, the Warriors managed only a few shots on Aerin Frankel before the Huskies got back to full strength.
The Huskies absorbed that early pressure and lashed out, striking first through junior forward Andrea Renner. Loose defending from the Warriors gifted Renner the puck on the left side of the cage with plenty of space. Her one-time shot went top-shelf, leaving Merrimack goalie Samantha Ridgewell stunned in place and giving the Huskies the 1-0 lead.
Before the period ended, the Huskies would make it two on a beautiful goal by senior forward Tori Sullivan. Hobson won the puck in the D-zone, flicking it on for Sullivan and allowing the forward to make her way up the ice, evading the Merrimack defense and finding a pocket of space staring down the Merrimack net. She wristed one past Ridgewell and into the bottom right corner off the goal, giving NU the 2-0 lead before the first break.
“I just happened to break up a play in the neutral zone, and my linemate went straight to the net, opened up a lane for me to kind of pull the puck and screen the goalie a little bit,” Sullivan said. “Took a shot, and it happened to go in.”
After a long stretch without any stoppages, the Huskies were able to take advantage of some tired Warrior legs and strike for goal No. three. A swift rush from NU’s first line attack saw Alina Mueller take the puck through the neutral zone and down the left wing, before turning and finding her fellow freshman forward Chloe Aurard across the ice. Aurard had time to take her shot and went low, allowing senior forward Kasidy Anderson to hit a redirect past Ridgewell from point-blank range. The goal marked Anderson’s 50th collegiate goal for the Huskies.
A minute and four seconds later, the Huskies had their fourth. Skylar Fontaine played a pass towards the center from behind the goal, and it was deflected slightly into the path of freshman forward Miceala Sindoris. Sindoris hit a first-time flick on the backhand past Ridgewell for her first career collegiate goal.
“I saw Skylar racing for the puck, and I knew I had to get to the net and she would get the puck to me, and right when it went in I saw Renner coming at me with her arms wide open,” Sindoris said. “I know everyone’s been pushing for me after the last couple games, I felt like I almost had a monkey on my back. So I felt a big relief and I had all my teammates coming towards me, cheering me on.”
Merrimack hit back 59 seconds after Sindoris’ goal. Forward Katelyn Rae sent a cross in front of goal, and it took a deflection off the stick of a Husky defender and slid past Frankel.
The start of the third period saw Merrimack replace Samantha Ridgewell with Lea-Kristine Demers in net, but she did not fare much better, conceding a goal at 3:48 of the period. With the Huskies attacking on the power play, they turned to their power-play-scoring expert, sophomore forward Veronika Pettey. Mueller played the puck across the face of goal to Pettey, who ripped a wrist shot near-post and past Demers for goal number five. The goal was Pettey’s seventh power-play goal of the season, which leads the NCAA.
Merrimack struck back a little over a minute later, as a point shot from Paige Sorensen was redirected in by forward Megan Fergusson.
Merrimack got its third late in the third after they won a faceoff in the attacking zone, giving defender Dominique Kremer roon to shoot. She wristed one low from the point, and it made its way through a crowd and past Frankel to make it 5-3.
But the Huskies weren’t done, as they capitalized on an empty net chance with 11.7 seconds remaining in the game to score their sixth. Skylar Fontaine found Mueller in front on the rush, and Mueller, despite mishitting her shot, was able to tuck it in from close range.
“I thought we did a good job burying our chances that we had, but [we] were still sloppy,” head coach Dave Flint said. “Credit to Merrimack though, they play hard and they play a good system. I’m happy we won, but thought we could have been better.”
It was a huge response from the Huskies after their shootout loss to BU in the Beanpot Tuesday. They will not be competing for a Beanpot trophy next week, but they still have other ambitions.
“I told the team after Tuesday, I said ‘Listen, you played the No. 8 team in the country, one of the hottest teams in the country right now, it was a 3-3 tie which, that’s how it shows up pair-wise,’” Flint said. “Today we needed a win to clinch a regular season championship, and there’s a lot bigger things that we need to take care of.”
The Huskies got at least one goal from each of their attacking lines Friday, including two from both the first and second lines.
“Successful teams, if they rely to heavy on one line and then all of a sudden that line isn’t scoring, then you’re gonna have trouble,” Flint said. “We’re getting it from all of our lines, we’re  getting it from our D, so I’m happy to see that it’s spreading around.”
NU earned a share of the Hockey East regular season title with the win. With either another win or a BC tie or loss, they will claim the title.
“We’re really big on unity, I think through all the ups and downs, like after Tuesday we knew we had to come back stronger,” Sindoris said. “We’ve all been staying together, staying positive through all the games, and we’ve just been working hard every game of the season, giving our all to try to get to this point.”
The Huskies face BC on Tuesday in the Beanpot consolation game with a chance to strike a blow to their closest Hockey East challengers."

The Huskies (14-9, 8-3 CAA) couldn’t have asked for a better start on either side of the ball, as they forced a shot-clock violation on their first defensive possession and followed it up with an easy layup from senior guard Vasa Pusica. 
Pusica earned CAA Player of the Week honors due in large part to his 24-point, eight-rebound performance in a victory over Hofstra on Saturday, and picked up right where he left off this time out. Pusica had the pick and roll working with senior center Anthony Green early on — that partnership isn’t there every game, but the pair’s chemistry was on full display as Green connected on two lobs in the first few minutes and set multiple effective screens. 
Just before Green’s second slam, William & Mary’s (9-15, 5-7 CAA) star forward Nathan Knight went down holding his ankle. Knight is pivotal to the Tribe’s offense, leading them in scoring with 19.2 points per game  with 8.1 rebounds per game. Thankfully, Knight was able to walk off the court on his own, and managed to return later in the half. 
The Huskies capitalized on his absence, however, as they were able to find the gaps when William & Mary shifted to a 3-2 zone. Junior guard Jordan Roland connected on back-to-back 3s to push the lead to 26-11 before Knight returned to action. 
“We’re always looking for the open man, it just happened to be me a couple times and I just knocked them down,” Roland said. 
Northeastern continued to be aggressive on the offensive end but was held back by some sloppy turnovers. William & Mary broke off a 12-2 run in response — Green was called for a foul on a made layup from Knight, which made it a 28-24 game in favor of Northeastern after he connected on the free throw. 
Sophomore forward Tomas Murphy snapped the cold spell after finishing on a composed post move, and from there the levee broke for Northeastern’s offense. They connected on three straight 3s, including a rare make from deep from Murphy, and a step-back jumper from Roland at the buzzer completed a 13-0 run giving Northeastern a 41-24 advantage at the half. 
“[Murphy] has actually been shooting the ball percentage-wise really well,” head coach Bill Coen said. “He doesn’t get many attempts … we got secondary action off of that, he felt confident and let it go, so that’s good for us.” 
The second half began with the teams trading buckets — Knight connected on a layup and Green answered with a ferocious dunk. A made 3 from junior guard Bolden Brace extended the lead to 46-28, and the Huskies seemed poised to continue to grow their advantage. 
The Tribe would not be dismayed, as they broke off an 8-0 run to cut things to 47-38. Murphy broke the drought again when Pusica found him on the perimeter for an open three. Pusica put on a show yet again for the Matthews Arena crowd, finishing with 19 points to go with seven rebounds, seven assists and three steals. 
He did so with some flair as well — with one second remaining on the shot clock on an inbound play, Pusica caught forward Justin Pierce with his back turned and bounced the ball off Pierce to himself, and converted on the layup. 
Northeastern went cold late in the half, and only converted two of its final 10 shot attempts. Pierce split a pair of free throws to cut the lead to 63-57, but three consecutive forced turnovers for the Huskies as well as strong free throw shooting kept the Tribe at bay. Though William & Mary outscored Northeastern in the second half, the Huskies walked away with their third straight win, 72-60. 
“We were trying to be aggressive because we were in the bonus and double bonus fairly early, and we do have confidence being able to close out games at the free throw line,” Coen said. “But with team like William & Mary … momentum can shift quickly because they’re a great 3-point shooting team.” 
With the victory, Northeastern stays put at second in the conference with a record of 14-9 (8-3 CAA). The Huskies host Elon (8-17, 4-8 CAA) this Saturday at Matthews Arena."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57556/editorial/column-theres-more-to-the-wall-battle-than-politics/,Column: There’s more to the wall battle than politics,"Matt Hersey, columnist","February 7, 2019","From where I live on the 17th floor of International Village, I see tennis courts behind Ruggles, surrounded by a fence. Considering the 35-day government shutdown that recently ended — for now — I can’t help but ponder the consequences physical barriers represent.
At the tennis courts, the fence signals a field of play; it keeps pedestrians and dog walkers out and keeps players and balls in. By all accounts, it’s convenient to have a fence there. The same fence used, per se, at a country club to separate people into groups is another story. 
Our country has used walls and signs to separate groups before. A new wall would simply target a new group of humans beings; namely those humans fleeing hardship and violence in Central America.
When we read in the news about the president standing firm for 35 days, withholding paychecks and furloughing employees, we need to know how he has the power to do so. 
Every year, Congress writes a bill that appropriates funding to be spent in every federal agency and institution. These funds become wages, investments, maintenance and whatever budget items the government may need. Every year since 2001, the government has run out early. 
No president wants to be the one who signs a historically large budget into law. Normally, the House of Representatives writes bills to keep the government funded, which the Senate may revise before passing it themselves. The bills are eventually signed into law by the president, who may also veto the bill. This is where President Donald J. Trump found his opportunity to force Congress to act on his proposition.
This year, the House of Representatives flipped from a Republican to a Democratic majority after November’s midterm elections. During this shutdown, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer negotiated with Trump on the supplementary appropriations bill. Democrats wouldn’t produce a bill involving a border wall and Trump refused to sign a bill without it. 
The last time the government shut down for an extended period was in December 2013, under President Barack Obama. While processes have not changed, there are many differences between these two shutdowns.
First, Obama refused to pass an appropriations bill that would raise the deficit ceiling to fully fund the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Signed into law in 2010, it would not go into effect until 2014. The larger issue at hand was not the Affordable Care Act, but raising the debt ceiling. Ultimately, the Republican majority in Congress compromised. 
The national debt as of Feb. 3 is nearly $22 trillion. There is no reason Congress would lose sleep over $5.7 billion. So why should the government remain shut down for 35 days, making it the longest shutdown in the history of the United States?
The true battle lies in what this wall represents. It would not keep stray dogs out of tennis courts or tennis balls from bludgeoning pedestrians. This wall would prompt our children to ask who resides on the other side and why we’ve separated them.
We don’t need a wall. We don’t need Americans rationing insulin or money for food. We certainly don’t need elderly elite politicians making decisions that will handicap our empathy tomorrow. 
America is the land of the free. Nothing separates me from people approaching our southern border today except the color of my skin and the port my family entered through. 
The president has referred to his desire for a wall as a solution to the “growing humanitarian crisis on our southern border.” I agree. This humanitarian issue deserves a humanitarian response, not a cold, rigid steel wall."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57554/sports/can-northeastern-rise-above-the-caa-with-coen-at-the-controls-its-possible/,"Can Northeastern rise above the CAA? With Coen at the controls, it’s possible","Charlie Wolfson, editor-in-chief","February 7, 2019","Northeastern entered the season as the consensus pick to win the CAA and advance to the NCAA Tournament after coming within a couple points of doing so last season. What was last year a very young and talented roster was expected to mature and overtake its league competition.
Things rarely work out in such a tidy way year-to-year in collegiate athletics. Bill Coen, in his 13th season as head coach, has dealt with a chain of issues that have his team at 7-3 in the conference behind Hofstra at 9-1.

Shawn Occeus, a starting junior guard and last year’s CAA Defensive Player of the Year, has been limited to just 11 games this year. He didn’t appear at all until Dec. 8, and had to sit out Saturday’s huge game against Hofstra due to undisclosed injuries.
Vasa Pusica has only played 15 games this season. Pusica is the driving force of the team; almost every offensive possession runs through him at point guard and he’s important on the defensive end as well. He has averaged 16 points per game, leaving a gaping hole in his absence.
NU’s three conference losses (at Delaware, at Hofstra, at Towson) came by a combined eight points. In the Delaware game, five players scored in double figures, but NU’s three centers combined for just five rebounds. Two Delaware forwards combined for 18. At Towson, NU got outrebounded as a team 38-18.

But after a huge win Saturday at Matthews Arena over previously-undefeated Hofstra, things are looking up for the Huskies. The CAA will only get one NCAA Tournament bid, which means that all that matters is winning the conference tournament in March. NU doesn’t need to catch Hofstra in the standings — though they could, they’re just two games back — they need to enter the tournament hot and execute in the big games.
How did Northeastern, a team that got outrebounded badly in three CAA losses, rout Hofstra by 14 to end the Pride’s nation-best 16-game winning streak? The answer is why NU fans should be feeling good about this team’s chances: Bill Coen is a top-notch coach at the mid-major level, and he showed it on Saturday.
The first and most obvious challenge for Coen and his players Saturday was that their best defensive player (Occeus) went down with an injury at the worst possible time. Hofstra’s electric senior guard Justin Wright-Foreman is by all measures the toughest guard in the CAA. 
He came in as the third-highest scorer in the nation with 26 points per game, and his presence drew the national media and the Boston Celtics’ general manager Danny Ainge to Matthews to see him. With Occeus out, Donnell Gresham Jr. drew the hefty assignment of trying to contain Wright-Foreman. 
Wright-Foreman’s line on Saturday: 15 points, three fouls, five turnovers, no assists and three rebounds on 5-14 shooting.
“We were without Shawn [Occeus] today, and Donnell stepped up and drew the defensive assignment on Wright-Foreman,” Coen said after the game. “I thought he did a really great job on him, as best as anybody could do for us. From the jump, that really set the tone.”
He didn’t just send Gresham out to try to shut down Wright-Foreman on his own, though. He tasked his frontcourt of Anthony Green, Tomas Murphy and Jeremy Miller with protecting the interior so Gresham was free to be aggressive on the ball at the perimeter. 
“I thought Donnell was really good getting physical on the ball, and I thought the three guys behind the ball did a really good job picking up the pieces,” Coen said. “[Wright-Foreman] is just so shifty with the ball, he can split ball screens, he can dribble around the big, he can pull back and duck behind 3s. He’s an incredibly hard guard for anybody.”
Pusica said NU has “other players who can defend” in Occeus’ absence and reiterated the team approach to defense.
“Red [Gresham] stepped up today,” Pusica said. “It comes down to team defense, and I think we did a good job with that. That’s how you play against players and teams like that. It’s got to be team defense.”
The duel between Pusica and Wright-Foreman came to a key point, in terms of coaching, midway through the first half. Each picked up a pair of fouls, and their respective coaches had to weigh the benefit of leaving them on the floor against the risk of having them foul out. Saturday’s result can be traced to the fact that Hofstra coach Joe Mihalich sat Wright-Foreman down immediately, and Coen left Pusica in the game in a key calculated risk.
“He’s an experienced player,” Coen said. “When you have a player like that, and you have a player with a pretty good game going just sit and marinate on the bench, sometimes they don’t get it going again. We want to make sure they stay in touch with the game.
“I know Vasa can count to five.”
Pusica didn’t sweat the foul trouble, and he dragged the weight of his fouls to a 24-point, eight-rebound, two-steal, 7-12-shooting, 37-minute output. 
“I’m just out there playing,” he said. “I could’ve done a better job not getting those fouls, and then playing better defense while I had those two fouls. Guys were attacking me and I probably could’ve put a little more effort into that [if I didn’t have the fouls]. It just means I’m part of this and that he believes in me.”
Wright-Foreman couldn’t get into a rhythm in the second half, and aside from one explosive dunk couldn’t “score in bunches,” as Coen feared he would. Post-game, Mihalich said he always sits players down when they’ve accrued two early fouls.
Another Coen masterstroke came when Hofstra picked up a technical foul, allowing Coen to choose which Husky would go to the line for two free throws — the pressure-packed kind with nobody lining up to rebound and no live ball after the shot. He could’ve sent Pusica to the line — he was clearly locked in from the floor that day. Instead, Coen tapped Jordan Roland.
Roland had struggled up to that point in the game, and had yet to make a field goal. But Coen saw the transfer guard who shoots 91 percent from the line and took an opportunity to get the sharpshooter going.
“Shooters, sometimes [they] just need to see it go in, and the net moves the way it always moves, and there’s life in the gym,” Coen said. “He’s got a temperament to go up in a big game with nobody on the line and make shots.”
Roland drained both, and went 2-2 from long range the rest of the way to finish with 10 points. Yet again, Coen made a gamble and it paid off in a big way.
Coen being a master tinkerer is nothing new. Last year, he started the season with then-sophomore guard Bolden Brace in his starting lineup. It made sense at the time: Brace was coming off an intriguing freshman year that included a 40-point explosion at Elon. But Brace struggled early on in the role, and simultaneously, the newcomer Pusica was emerging as a go-to scorer and ball handler. 
Coen swapped Brace out of the starting lineup after just a few games and installed Pusica as the focal point of the offense. Pusica thrived in the role of minutes-eater, and Brace provided a spark off the bench every night.
Full marks to Brace for being flexible, but it’s impressive that Coen was able to demote a player in terms of court time and end up getting more production out of said player. Brace averaged a healthy 7.9 points per game off the bench last year, plus 4.7 rebounds and a couple assists. 
Brace arrived on campus this fall ready to enter the starting lineup: So far he’s averaged 9.4 points per game, 2.7 assists, 5.1 rebounds, 40 percent 3-point shooting and just 1.4 turnovers on 29.8 minutes per game. It’s fair to say that Coen’s handling of this player throughout his three years at NU has been impressive, and perhaps masterful.
A challenge still awaits this team if it is to get to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2014, Devon Begley’s freshman year. They are unlikely to get the top seed in the conference tournament, which will render their path through the tournament harder than it was last year. 
And then there are the intangibles. Northeastern was poised to knock down the tough College of Charleston in the championship last year, and led by double digits, but still fell in overtime. That could fuel them or it could make them second-guess themselves. With Coen at the helm, though, one would lean toward expecting them to learn from their past rather than being haunted by it.
“Our guys stepped up and took the challenge,” Coen said of facing Hofstra without Occeus. “I think it’s going to take something like that in order to win a CAA championship. You need a full complement of starters and reserves and all hands on deck to beat a good program.”
Pusica pointed out that it’s not all a blessing to be preseason favorites. 
“We were picked to win this league, so every team against us is going to have a little more energy and a little more focus. We just need to match their energy every single time,” he said.
Coen closed his media session Saturday by indicating that he won’t simply lean on his team’s strengths (Pusica takes to the rim, Jordan Roland 3-pointers, getting Anthony Green 1-on-1 looks inside). He has a laundry list of upgrades for the team to make before they’re put to the test in Charleston, South Carolina next month.
“We’ve got to keep getting better,” he said. “We have three losses by a total of eight points. Can we get a possession or two better in our next game? Can we eliminate second chance baskets for our opponents? Can we eliminate turnovers? Can we shoot better from the line? Where can we improve? We need to keep getting better in order to accomplish [the CAA title].”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57531/campus/sga-widely-cuts-club-funding-but-maintains-56000-budget-including-stipends-for-officials/,"SGA widely cuts club funding but maintains near-$57,000 budget",,,"Student club budgets were cut across the board this November, some by as much as 40 percent, after the Student Government Association discovered that an increase in funding requests threatened to max out the pool of money created by the Student Activity Fee, or SAF.
Many clubs are now struggling to operate and have been forced to cancel plans and cut programs for the spring semester.
At the same time, SGA’s own budget was approved for all $56,991 it requested, including $2,250 stipends for nine SGA officials.
“We’ve just had this hard fluctuation between the number of clubs and how active they are,” said SGA President Dylan Balcom. “In recent years, the number of clubs on campus has just been skyrocketing … As we have more groups, and as groups become more active, we have less in the SAF pot to distribute.”
NUTV, for example, had to change plans for its popular film festival Campus Movie Fest. Though NUTV’s annual budget wasn’t decreased, the club was denied the $15,000 they normally receive for the event, which they’ve hosted on campus for 10 years. Advika Grover, an NUTV marketing director, said they should still be able to host the event with minor changes thanks to a compromise with the Movie Fest national association.
“This year they told us they could not give us any money at all for the event,” NUTV Vice President Brigitte Gong said. “Campus Movie Fest is special because it’s open to everyone at Northeastern, it’s the nation’s largest student film festival, and [losing] it would be a huge blow to the creative community.”
Every NU undergraduate student pays a $136 activity fee. This creates a pool of more than $2 million, according to the SGA Finance Board website. The board, whose voting members are all students, is tasked with distributing these funds to NU’s many student organizations. Recently, this was complicated by an increased volume of requests.
There are more than 500 clubs listed on the Center for Student Involvement website, and around 175 groups requested money this year, SGA Comptroller Max Willner-Giwerc said, though he said the breakdown of where the funds go is confidential.
Willner-Giwerc guides the Finance Board through deciding how to distribute funds generated by the SAF. Clubs make presentations to the Finance Board, making their case for why they should get a chunk of the activity fee. But neither he nor the board has access to a detailed breakdown — he said the university requires that to be confidential due to “privacy concerns.”
The activity fee increases only with inflation, not with the rise in funding requests. Willner-Giwerc and Balcom said the rise in funding requests created a budgetary conflict, and the student activity fund could not keep up with what those clubs hoped to achieve. Willner-Giwerc called this “growing pains.”
The board discovered if they didn’t cut club budgets significantly, there would be a deficit. But Willner-Giwerc and his team realized this in November, shortly before students were due to present their budget requests. At least two groups presented Nov. 14 after receiving an email the day before saying there would be budget decreases across campus.
“We calculated a worst-case scenario of having to cut 40 percent from every club’s budget,” said Willner-Giwerc, a second-year politics, philosophy and economics major. 
Clubs hit hard by cuts
The News spoke to 12 clubs for this story; almost all of them reported operational problems caused by the budgeting allotments.
Student science magazine NU Sci was hit hard by the cuts. Sage Wesenberg, the magazine’s editor-in-chief, said SGA cut their normal funding by 40 percent.
In the past, the club received enough money to print two magazines per semester, subscribe to a stock photo service and self-promote. This semester, they could only afford printing — and even then, they had to decrease their print circulation from 1,000 copies to between 500 and 750.
Wesenberg and club President Jackson Griffiths presented the group’s budget to the finance board in November. After they had already finished final preparations, they received the surprising email less than 24 hours before their presentation.
“The issue I had was, one, the notice,” said Griffiths, a fourth-year cell and molecular biology major. “We had been preparing for it for a long time and we found out [one day] before.”
This instant change of plans left the club leaders unsure of how to proceed into their presentations.
“We kept waiting for them to say something. I was surprised they let us speak for as long as we did,” said Wesenberg, a fifth-year biology major. “At the end, Max [Willner-Giwerc] said ‘So we have good news and bad news. The bad news is that your budget is going to be cut by 40 percent.’ To us, it wouldn’t have mattered if we presented at all.”
Willner-Giwerc declined to comment on this particular scenario but said that the board does not “make decisions going into a meeting,” rather they do research beforehand to prepare.
Tastemakers music magazine is another campus publication that finds itself in dire financial straits after November’s budget allocations. 
Lauren ScornavaccaTastemakers e-board members Grant Foskett, Hannah Crotty and Jason Levy pose with their music magazine.
Tastemakers submits four requests each year, which is the maximum for organizations that don’t qualify for an annual budget. (Only clubs that demonstrate they cannot operate on an event-to-event basis qualify for annual budgets.) 
Tastemakers requests money for one concert and one print magazine per semester. But in the latest round, SGA cut the magazine’s concert fund by 40 percent and the print budget by 30 percent. Tastemakers President Justine Cowan declined to provide the specific amounts.
Cowan didn’t know if she should stick to her original plan for the request or scale it down in light of the last-minute email.
“I debated if I wanted to acknowledge [the cuts] going in,” Cowan said. “I ultimately decided against it because I still wanted to argue my case for why I was requesting more money for the show. Ultimately it was because I believed a slight increase in funding would provide us a little more flexibility when negotiating with booking agents for artists we thought would have a much better draw for the Northeastern community.”
Cowan said the cuts mean they’ll order 500 copies of their next magazine instead of the typical 1,000. After that, they may be forced to go down to 300. 
Julia Thompson, the president of the NU Student Nurses Association, or NUSNA, planned to request funding for the club for the first time. After November’s news, she no longer felt that was viable.
“Our biggest expense is going to the national SNA convention,” Thompson said. “It’s a great experience for our members, but it’s very expensive. We were hoping to look into using the SAF to help cover registration costs.”
NU Stage President Sam Boggiano said the decreases are coming at a time of unexpected increased costs for the theatre club — they were recently required to provide increased security funds for its events.
“We’re talking about ways to decrease next year’s budget,” Boggiano said. “We’ve preemptively raised our dues from $15 to $20 because the security costs will definitely exceed our budget increase so we already know we will have problems.”
The decrease could alter the club’s productions noticeably, Boggiano said.
“We’ve started to talk about decreasing show budgets,” he said. “And that’s really unfortunate because we like to give our designers and our tech people the ability and resources to be creative and make some really great things.” 
Parker Brown, the president of WRBB, said the radio station is cutting back on marketing, technical equipment and catered events for its 200-plus members. 
NUTV actually received a budget increase this year, said Vice President Gong, though the Finance Board did not share the reason with them per their non-disclosure policy. Gong said she would have rather maintained the same budget if it meant having money for Movie Fest.
“Campus MovieFest is special because it’s open to everyone at Northeastern,” Gong said. “I think if we had been told beforehand … we could’ve found a way around it.”
Solutions fall short
Cowan, Griffiths and Wesenberg said the Finance Board offered them guidance on how to raise additional funds. But they were skeptical that the suggestions were practical.
Willner-Giwerc said suggestions included Husky Starter, a channel that groups can use to ask alumni for donations, grants from academic colleges and “outside endorsements,” though those are only available to competition groups. 
“Fundraising is difficult for a club like ours,” Griffiths said. “It’s obviously fun to be a member of NU Sci, and it’s rewarding to be printed, but it’s also a lot of work. And then to come back and say, ‘Can you pay for it too? Can you donate so we can run?’ is kind of a big thing to ask of our members.”
Wesenberg said the fundraising ideas were often more geared toward groups trying to fund one big event near the end of the year, not an ongoing publication. Cowan said the methods weren’t scalable enough. 
“Selling Krispy Kremes at Curry Crossroads or selling coffee, it gives you a little money but not anything substantial,” Cowan said, adding that she found it hard to fundraise during her time as president of a marketing club on campus.
Willner-Giwerc was optimistic that groups could make ends meet. He said some groups cut their own budgets or operated effectively within the reduced bounds, though he wouldn’t provide specific examples.
“They were creative and came up with new ideas,” Willner-Giwerc said. “The austerity of the budget will always be met by the creativity of our groups.” However, he did admit that “the system is a little bent right now,” and a new one is in the works.
An opaque process
Cowan, the Tastemakers president, also said she was not provided with specific reasons why the finance board came to its decision. 
“When I found out what they granted us, they essentially just said it was the blanket cut and there weren’t reasons specific to our organization,” Cowan said. “I haven’t received any specific reasons.”
Neither the Student Activities Business Office nor the Center for Student Involvement responded to requests for comment on who has access to the full distribution of the activity fee.
Willner-Giwerc said the reality is that nobody on the finance board can see a detailed breakdown of how student activity funds are allocated, not even the comptroller himself. 
It’s unclear what oversight applies to the board, and what effect it can have. SGA President Balcom had little-to-no details on the Finance Board’s activities or particulars.
“I don’t know the numbers,” Balcom said. “The goal is to never be in the red. I don’t know the specifics of the SAF allocations.”
To numerous questions about the SAF and the factors that go into SGA’s financial decisions, he referred The News to Willner-Giwerc.
Willner-Giwerc said that there are non-voting faculty representatives from the Center of Student Involvement and the Student Activities Business Office who sit on the Finance Board. Finance Board decisions are handed up to university administrators who do not have veto power.
These are the factors considered in allocating activity fee funds according to the SAF manual on the Finance Board’s website.
Though he said all details of board decisions are to remain confidential, Willner-Giwerc pointed to the association’s SAF manual, which contains the guidelines the board uses to reach its conclusions. The section outlining its criteria for budget requests is a long, unranked list of factors that gives the board wide discretion.
SGA’s operational budget
Despite the fiscal concerns, SGA itself received 100 percent of the funding it requested for this year. The association’s operating budget is proposed by the president and executive vice president and presented to the finance board like any other club’s budget. 
Yearly budgets like SGA’s were requested in June, which might explain why the decrease was only 2 percent from last year. But WRBB, which also operates on a yearly budget, was dealt a cut between 13 and 14 percent after requesting their 2018-19 budget in June, their President Parker Brown said. 
After November’s financial revelations, Balcom said he is planning a 5 percent cut for next year’s SGA budget. 
This year’s near-$57,000 budget included the following line items, among others:

$5,400 for “food,” which Balcom said included refreshments for SGA internal events and events SGA hosted for the student body and at orientations.
$5,750 for travel and lodging to an “Annual Fall Senate Retreat.”
$5,207 for SGA direct election candidates to campaign with.
$3,984 for “office equipment maintenance.”
Nine $2,250 stipends for SGA officials.

Only two of the nine stipend recipients are directly elected by the student body. Willner-Giwerc was elected by the Senate, along with six others.
Balcom said the officials’ many hours of work justifies the stipends. However, many club leaders The News spoke with reported spending similar amounts of time on their positions. No club leader The News spoke with reported requesting or receiving money for stipends.
To Balcom’s knowledge, no SGA operational budget request has been rejected by the Finance Board in his time in the association. 
“Without the stipends we wouldn’t be empowering our student body,” Willner-Giwerc said, explaining that some students can’t afford to work such a demanding position without pay. “Every student, no matter their background, should have a right to be a leader in that organization and make that change.”
An unclear future
Willner-Giwerc indicated that the next budget request cycle could have lighter cuts, or even none at all for some groups. Club leaders are still concerned about the future, though. 
“I’ll have to coach the future president through it,” said Cowan, the Tastemakers president. “I think it would probably be overly ambitious to request more funding. At the very least I would probably request the amount we have been granted in the past. Hopefully the worst-case scenario, we’d get what we got this semester.” 
Samantha BarrySGA President Dylan Balcom took office in November after the previous president’s resignation.
Wesenberg, the NU Sci editor, said she expects recurring cuts based on the drastic tone of this fall’s proceedings. From her perspective, she said it didn’t “seem like it would resolve in one semester.”
“We’re graduating. We don’t want to leave this as an issue for future groups,” Griffiths said.
Boggiano said he thinks it could get “harder and harder” going forward.
Brown said “I would not be surprised if they cut our budget again.”
But in an interview with The News, Willner-Giwerc painted a picture of a less dire situation than originally feared.
“Our worst case scenario was 40 percent,” he said. “Turns out we only needed to make about 20 percent cuts for a few [requests] and we’re right back on track.”
Even before November’s cuts, SGA’s four-request limit systematically prevented Tastemakers from requesting money for its website. Cowan has been paying for the magazine’s web domain and hosting out of her own pocket, as the previous president did. She’s currently trying to bring those costs down.
“I’m still trying to think through how to approach that going forward, because that’s not something that I think is fair to ask of someone, even if I’m okay doing it,” Cowan said. “There’s no way to request funds for the website.”
Editor’s note: The News does not request funding from the university in any form, and is independent from the university."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57540/editorial/letter-to-the-editor-let-northeastern-full-time-faculty-hold-a-union-election/,Letter to the editor: Let Northeastern full-time faculty hold a union election,,"February 7, 2019","We respect the diversity of opinions raised by colleagues who shared concerns about unionization in an article published last week, “Some full time, non-tenure track faculty are against unionization.” The choice to form a union is one we should make carefully — but it should be made by the faculty themselves, not by the administration. The existence of differing views is precisely why a democratic process is so important. 
As full-time, non-tenure track faculty, we are deeply invested in our departments, our scholarship and most of all, our students. It is because of this investment in our students that we continue to imagine how to improve our conditions as teachers. With that in mind, we applaud the spirit of recent efforts toward inclusion of non-tenure track voices through representation in the Faculty Senate and the “One Faculty” model. 
Yet, we remain concerned that we are “One Faculty” in name only. Without the power to bargain as equals, that spirit is lost. There are many issues that we are interested in as non-tenure track faculty: transparency in evaluations and promotions, fair compensation and more secure contracts, as well as Northeastern’s role in the Boston community. Only with a union can we enshrine these protections and improvements in a legal contract which cannot be altered without our consent.
That is why, in November, we filed for our union election with strong support from faculty across campus. The administration responded through its lawyers by claiming we are “managers” — a shocking stance that breaks from legal precedent and ignores the existence of full-time non-tenure track faculty unions at Tufts, Boston University, Lesley and other universities across the country. 
Despite letters and calls from tenured faculty, students, and community members urging a fair election — including a letter from Sen. Elizabeth Warren — Aoun refuses to drop the claim that we are managers and allow us to vote. In fact, he has not responded at all. 
Northeastern must not become an outlier on the issue of faculty rights. Instead, it should join colleges and universities, locally and nationwide, in respecting faculty’s right to self determination. We call on Aoun to embody the spirit of “One Faculty” — the spirit of valuing faculty voice — and allow full-time non-tenure track faculty to vote.

https://huntnewsnu.com/57536/editorial/column-black-history-month-celebrates-american-greatness/,Column: Black History Month celebrates American greatness,"Melissa Wells, opinion editor","February 7, 2019","Without fail, two thoughts come to mind every year when February swings by: one, the frustration expressed by James Baldwin not so long ago that American history has been taught without “cognizance of my presence.” Two, the negligence of many Americans to understand the necessity and importance of the established tradition of Black History Month, going as far as branding it “racist.”
I won’t bother explaining why Black History Month isn’t racist. At this juncture in American history, one must be entirely unconscious of the state of our union to dismiss the white supremacy and racial ignorance that continues to prevail in America. 
If I could, I would banish the term “post-racial” from our vocabulary. Electing a black president once did not save white people from privilege, even if it did make the world a little better. What surprises me about racial ignorance today is that American exceptionalism dominates even our teachings of history and Americans consciously choose to ignore true aspects of this history. 
After white Americans enslaved an entire race for 400 years, stripping them of the basic privileges guaranteed to any other human being under our Constitution and incarcerating two thirds of that population under the guise of law and order, we have the right not to “forget about the past.” We get 28 days each year to celebrate the excellence that prevailed within this brutal history, to honor those history forgot or erased and celebrate one another as we continue to struggle for racial equality.
That in and of itself comes with responsibility — a responsibility to make American history inclusive of our stories in whatever way we must, even if it means reminding our society throughout February that our lives matter 365 days of the year. I am reminded of a quote by Vernon Jordan, in a speech he gave at Howard University in 2002. In the context of Black History Month, it salutes the black ancestors we thank for the opportunities they bravely fought for, even as they weren’t able to see those struggles come to fruition.
“You are where you are today because you stand on somebody’s shoulders. And wherever you are heading, you cannot get there by yourself. If you stand on the shoulders of others, you have a reciprocal responsibility to live your life so that others may stand on your shoulders. It’s the quid pro quo of life. We exist temporarily through what we take, but we live forever through what we give.” 
It’s a solemn fact that many parallels exist in black history that resonate too closely with how black life is treated today. It was Emmett Till then and it’s Trayvon Martin now. From the police brutality that resulted in men and women dying for equality of livelihood then, to the men and women dying now for the audacity of equality in coffee shops, dorm buildings and traffic stops. 
For a country that is desperate for black culture, but still devalues black life, it should come as no surprise that black Americans refuse to applaud fixtures of the brutal history against us — like the Pledge of Allegiance or the National Anthem, both of which feature phrases that remain unfulfilled. In the past, we’ve sacrificed everything to believe in equality, and we’ll continue to do so.
But, in the midst of that pain, I find joy to see the comparisons of success, from each stride we make today across all industries to the struggles to survive and thrive that allowed us to have the chance to even do so. 
First it was Josephine Baker, the first black woman to star in a major motion picture, and now it’s 14-year-old Marsai Martin, the youngest executive producer in Hollywood. It was Coretta Scott King who black women of the 1960s looked to, and it’s Michelle Obama, the most educated First Lady to grace our history books, that they look to today. 
Our history is dark, but we have always paved a path for the success of future generations. So, this month, The News will dedicate a column each week to this celebration — a small gesture to a community ingrained in the foundation of this country and essential to that American greatness we all applaud today.
For the culture, indeed."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57507/lifestyle/country-fans-raise-a-glass-to-eric-church/,Country fans raise a glass to Eric Church,"Riley Robinson, news staff","February 7, 2019","Who knew so many people owned cowboy boots in the Boston area?
It almost seemed there was a required uniform to attend Eric Church’s Double Down Tour Friday and Saturday at TD Garden. The boots peeked out from actual bootcut jeans or stomped proudly outside a pair of leggings. Men wore plaid flannel shirts and trucker ball caps. A Tom Brady jersey was also acceptable.
It made sense to dress comfortably, because this was a marathon of a concert. Church’s tour takes a novel approach, playing a two-night series in 19 cities, with different set lists across both nights. On Saturday, he sang for more than three hours, with one intermission and no opener. 
It was certainly a country show, but with a rock ’n’ roll vibe and a flair for showmanship. Strobes crossed from the arena ends, so crisp and close it seemed you could pluck one and it would vibrate in sympathy with the guitar slung on Church’s shoulder. He’s mastered the tongue-out head bop and the I-don’t-care swagger, which he employed on a square catwalk that encircled a general admission section for superfans, nestled in with the band. 
This group is called the Church Choir. It was a place for drinking and dancing and yelling “Beat L.A.!” into the darkness at the top of your lungs. Actually, everyone was standing and dancing, even at the top row of the top balcony. Swaying couples dotted the audience — were they worried about static sparks in all that flannel?
It wouldn’t matter, because any fires could have been drenched out with alcohol. (That’s how that works, right?) Hands gripping cups of beer rose up in synchrony at “Drink in My Hand,” a platinum hit from the summer of 2011. Church opened the night with an ode to the local bartender, with the song “Drowning Man” off his sixth studio album, Desperate Man, released in October. 
Dylan ShenChurch performed for more than three hours to a thundering TD Garden Saturday night.
Church himself is more of a whiskey guy, Jack Daniel’s specifically. He has a whole song dedicated to it, during which he jumped off the stage and poured an entire bottle worth of shots for nearby fans. When he returned to the stage, a small boy reached up from the front row, offering Church a nip from an outstretched hand.
Interactions like this were a motif of the night: Church’s fans liked to give him stuff. People intermittently passed up American flag-print scarves for Church to drape behind his neck like a priest’s stole. They passed up records for him to sign during “Record Year.” 
The cowboy boots got their own moment of glory during the throwback track “These Boots” from Church’s first album. Throughout the stadium, audience members took a boot off one foot to wave in the air — or throw onstage. Church did his best to toss them back to their sock-footed owners. 
From the barrage of boots and records and homemade signs bearing his name, it was clear Church is beloved by his fans, even as far north as Boston.
Jean Sullivan of Marshfield, Massachusetts, is one of these dedicated fans. She usually brings her daughter to country concerts in the area, but attended her third Church show Saturday with a friend, both decked out in red and blue Patriots apparel. 
“Eric Church’s style is a man’s man type of singer. He’s got his dog, he’s got his beer. He talks about the country, talks about hunting, talks about standing up for what he believes in,” Sullivan said. “Don’t get me wrong, women love him, but he’s definitely a man’s man singer.”
Church may be a “man’s man” who appreciates a good drink, but he was still momentarily apprehensive at a young boy offering him liquor mid-show. 
“I don’t know if I’m comfortable with this,” Church said with a chuckle. “What are you, seven? Eight? Oh, ten, you’re ten.” Church took the bottle, threw it back and yelled, “Welcome to Boston!”"

https://huntnewsnu.com/57513/editorial/op-ed-trans-joining-the-military-isnt-a-problem/,Op-ed: Trans joining the military isn’t a problem,Paige Stern,"February 6, 2019","On July 26, 2017, President Donald J. Trump tweeted, “After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military. Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you.”
Fast forward to Jan. 22, 2019: the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to allow the Trump administration to put this transgender military ban into effect while the case is debated in lower courts. 
What exactly does this ban entail? How much do transgender members of the military cost our government? 
Let’s start from the top. Until the Obama administration, service members could be discharged from the military for openly identifying as transgender. In 2016, Obama declared transgender service members could be open about their identity without putting their military service on the line. 
On July 1, 2017, individuals who were openly transgender could enlist. However, that date continued to be delayed under the Trump administration, which insisted the issue needed to be further researched. Thus, we arrive at the extraordinary repercussions of Trump’s decision to roll back Obama’s policy.
If put into effect, the policy will permit current transgender service members to continue serving. However, it prohibits transgender individuals from enlisting into the military unless they are willing to serve as the sex they are biologically assigned to. However, the main difference between the service of men and women in the military is just their grooming and appearance standards.
More than 15,000 transgender individuals serve in the military, while Trump and his military experts — which the administration has chosen not to identify — suggest transgender service members are gnawing away at the U.S. Defense budget. But a study by the RAND Corporation in 2016, “Assessing the Implications of Allowing Transgender Personnel to Serve Openly,” disproves Trump’s claims. According to Forbes’s analysis of the study, the group found “the cost of gender-related care for transgender service members would be $2.4 to $8.4 million annually, out of Defense Department healthcare expenditures of $49.3 billion.” 
I understand that $8.4 million is a lot of money, but when it is out of nearly $50 billion, it only accounts for .0168 percent of the budget. 
From the research, or the many anecdotes by transgender service members featured on multiple episodes of Ellen, I hope you as a reader, and  a voter, see the point. 
To reject a potential military member because of the person’s identity is not just wrong, it denies their right to express who they are. These individuals are being denied from serving as the gender they mentally and emotionally exist as, and it is disheartening. Even if the administration makes it an option to serve as your biological gender, for most transgender individuals, that isn’t even a choice; it is a discriminatory insult to their identity."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57458/campus/community-members-protest-raytheons-presence-at-nu-career-fair/,Community members protest Raytheon’s presence at NU career fair,"Christopher Kelly, news correspondent","February 6, 2019","Protesters with homemade signs stood outside the Dana Research Center Jan. 29, opposing Raytheon’s participation in a career fair employer panel. Raytheon is a Massachusetts-based contractor for the U.S. military, and protestors accused the contractor of profiting off of the bombings in Yemen by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. 
The group of approximately 10 people consisting of both community members and Northeastern students gathered outside of the employer panel carrying signs with phrases such as “Study war no more,” and “How many school buses did you bomb today?” The protestors also carried small backpacks with the names and ages of children killed by an airstrike that had hit a school bus during the conflict in Yemen. 
Neither Raytheon nor the university responded to multiple requests for comment for this story.
Ryan Costello, a community member who said that he has been actively protesting ‘war profiteers’ for years, was a leader of the protest.
“I had read in Al Jazeera how brutal the situation in Yemen was, and that bombs had fallen with Raytheon and other U.S. company serial numbers on them, hitting hospitals and water treatment plants,” Costello said. “I understand that the economic situation in the country is dire, but for the betterment of society I don’t think that students should work for a company like Raytheon.”
Protesters also handed out fliers and shouted phrases outside of the doors of the employer panel such as “Raytheon are merchants of death,” and “No more recruitment for war profiteers.”
NUPD asked protesters to move as they were blocking the doors of the Dana Research Center. They moved to the sidewalk along Forsyth Street in front of Ruggles where they continued their chants. The group began speaking into a megaphone and handed out fliers to students.
The fliers accused Raytheon of being a major arms supplier for Saudi Arabia, and said they were responsible for delivering $2.5 billion in weapons to Saudi Arabia. 
Costello said he is optimistic on how the strife was drawing a response from other Americans, particularly among young students. 
“I think that the anti-war movement in this country has made great strides in getting normal people to start calling their senators and asking them to not support companies like this. I think that there is a growing movement here,” Costello said.
Costello also asked that any young engineers who were being recruited by Raytheon put their efforts into projects that do not focus on the defense sector, but rather work on helping society. 
“This is a protest not just for Raytheon, but for all the weapons manufacturers who reach out to students,” Costello said. “This is also a protest against Northeastern who has deep ties with Raytheon. I think that we need to push back as community members against war profiteers being invited to schools. They shouldn’t be accepting donations from them. They shouldn’t be having career fairs with them. They sure as hell shouldn’t be investing in them.”
Christopher KellyCommunity members gather on Forsyth Street to protest Raytheon’s involvement in an NU employer panel.
A student from Boston University, Chance Charley, also attended the protest. 
“As a U.S. citizen, I feel like I have a duty to stand up with these people and oppose these wars abroad along with these companies that are profiting hand over fist from killing children,” Charley said.
Cole Harrison, the executive director of Massachusetts Peace Action, said this was the beginning of a series of protests that they were organizing. 
“We are the largest peace group in Massachusetts, and we are opposed to nuclear weapons, U.S. wars and interventions and we want to cut the military budget and move the budget to things that people really need in our country,” Harrison said. “Raytheon is a leech and a war profiteer.” 
Harrison was disappointed by  Raytheon’s presence at NU’s career fair, but he was pleased with the demonstration and is expecting greater numbers of protestors in the future. 
Raytheon will be back for another on-campus career fair Feb. 14, and Massachusetts Peace Action plans to protest again. The group plans to protest at MIT, Boston University and Tufts University before returning to Northeastern.
“Saudi Arabia is attempting to take over Yemen as its neighboring country and Raytheon is helping them,” Harrison said. “Yemen is the greatest humanitarian crisis in the world. This company is trying to attract Northeastern students to work for them, and in order to stop this war they should get off campus and they should not sell weapons to Saudi Arabia.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57508/campus/rsa-responds-to-concerns-surrounding-2018-husky-hunt-challenges/,RSA responds to concerns surrounding 2018 Husky Hunt challenges,"Rachel Morford, news correspondent","February 6, 2019","Video challenges written for Northeastern’s annual Husky Hunt, sponsored by the Resident Student Association, asked participants to film their team recreating culture-specific scenarios — including performing the ancient Chinese art of Peking opera. Several participating students considered these challenges inappropriate and culturally insensitive, and demanded change from RSA. 
“Do they want us to do this in a mocking way? Are we supposed to be making fun of this? Or are we supposed to truly research the style of the singing and the style of the makeup and actually reenact it that way?” said Alice Ding, a fifth-year marketing and computer science major and one of the team captains of the 2018 Husky Hunt, which took place in November.
The competition is an annual 24-hour city-wide scavenger hunt and is considered a university tradition, according to Northeastern’s website. Each fall, 50 qualifying teams of 12 NU students race to complete a series of challenges which take participants throughout Greater Boston.  
“The theme of this year’s Husky Hunt was time travel,” said CJ Lalime, a fifth-year marketing and management major and RSA president. “We had different time periods we focused on for an hour throughout the hunt.” 
Ding’s team, consisting predominantly of Asian-American students, was made uncomfortable by video challenge 18. According to the sheet given to Husky Hunt participants, this challenge read: “Create a 30 [second] video of two of your group member[s] performing peking opera.” Peking is a proper noun synonymous with the Chinese capital Beijing — and should be capitalized. This challenge was created for the “Ancient China” aspect of the theme. 
“When I saw [the challenge] during the actual hunt, right then and there I was like, ‘Oh, no, we’re not doing this,’” said Jenny Cheung, a fifth-year majoring in computer engineering, and a member of Ding’s Husky Hunt team. “ So we talked about it the next day, and said, ‘Yeah, we’re going to send an email out.’”
On Nov. 19, the morning after the event, she emailed Lalime directly, in addition to the RSA Husky Hunt email address and RSA’s advisor, Christina Alch. Of the challenges in question, Ding highlighted three specifically — recreating the music video to the song “Boney M.” by Rasputin, recreating the original Thanksgiving and performing Peking opera. All of these challenges put students in a position to imitate other cultures, Ding said. 
“The make-up, the singing style and clothing all represent different aspects of Chinese culture and the idea of using them as a way of getting ahead in an American-based scavenger hunt felt wrong,” Ding said in her Nov. 19 email to RSA. “The thought of other students mimicking and trying to recreate this aspect of Chinese culture made many of us uncomfortable.”
The RSA’s response came nine days later, on Nov. 28. Concerned that RSA would not respond, Ding contacted other Northeastern officials in the interim, including Bob Jose, associate dean for Cultural, Residential and Spiritual life, and Delia Cheung Hom, who was director of the Asian American Center at the time. 
“While our hope was that teams would do the research in order to respectfully complete these challenges, we now realize the impact that the challenges had,” Lalime said in his Nov. 28 reply to Ding, speaking on behalf of RSA. “We would like apologize for making you and your team members feel uncomfortable during the hunt.”
Lalime ended the email by stating that teams would not be penalized for not completing the highlighted video challenges. Ding said she and her team members did not consider RSA’s response proportionate to the mistake made. 
“Their response was basically a brush-off, saying ‘Oh, I’m sorry. And also, by the way, since you brought this up, we won’t count those videos, as points if you didn’t complete them,’” Cheung said. “And that doesn’t necessarily solve the problem, because that means if no one had brought it up, you would still continue to do the same thing.”
Lalime said in the future, RSA intends to require more oversight for the challenges the Husky Hunt committee creates. Currently, no university approval is required for each specific challenge. In order to address the insensitivity which led to the creation of the challenges in the first place, Lalime said RSA is scheduled to complete a training with NU’s Social Justice Resource Center this semester. Additionally, Lalime said RSA hopes to expand the efforts of its Diversity and Inclusion Task Force, which is committed to expanding representation within the organization. 
“We didn’t realize the impact the challenges would have, the intent with which we created them was vastly different from the impact that they had,” Lalime said.
However, Ding was not made aware of RSA’s intended actions. In a follow-up email sent to Lalime on Nov. 28, Ding again outlined her concerns about RSA, and her fear that nothing had  changed. 
“For us to have felt so weird to have these specific prompts, they just need to do better,” Ding said. “You shouldn’t be using your platform to perpetuate the foreign aspects of culture.”
Ding never received a response to her Nov. 28 follow-up email to RSA. Ding and Cheung said this lack of response left them pessimistic about the likelihood of the hunt being more inclusive in the future. However, Lalime said the lack of response was not due to apathy, but a desire to have actionable examples of how RSA intended to address Ding’s concerns. 
“It wasn’t my intention to not respond,” Lalime said. “The initial email was delayed because of timing and wanting to make sure we addressed all of her concerns, because they are incredibly valid. I did not want to send the next email until I could say ‘We do hear all of your concerns. Here is my list of things we are doing to prevent this from happening in the future.’”
In the two months since Ding’s initial email, Lalime said RSA has been weighing the consequences of their actions on the students they intend on representing, and how scenarios like this could be avoided in the future. 
“We didn’t necessarily see it coming, but once it was pointed out to us, we all felt the severity of our actions,” Lalime said. “There’s nothing worse than directly contradicting what we hope to do for residents on this campus and students in general.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57503/lifestyle/local-historical-fantasy-authors-gather-at-trident/,Local historical fantasy authors gather at Trident,"Riana Buchman, news correspondent","February 6, 2019","Under dimmed lights at Trident Booksellers & Cafe, New England historical fantasy authors read excerpts from their novels for a handful of attendees on the second floor of the bookstore Thursday night.
The event was a combined networking event and reading series run by Speculative Boston and Bookbuilders of Boston.
“This time it’s working out perfectly,” said Caitlin Kling, an event coordinator for Trident. “It did last time as well, where an hour before the Spec Fiction event starts, the Bookbuilders come and do some networking and have name tags, so everyone knows each other, and then it kind of transitions seamlessly.” 
Speculative Boston, or Spec Boston, is a reading series founded last April by Andrea Corbin, who was also at the event. Bookbuilders of Boston is a nonprofit organization that organizes events for those interested in book publishing and manufacturing.
“We have a lot of literary fiction series and poetry series. I wanted one that was about sci-fi, fantasy, horror and all the different genres that I’ve loved all my life and so many of my friends do,” Corbin said.
Corbin handpicked authors for the reading event Thursday. As the sole coordinator at the start of the series, Corbin gathered a list of New England authors from her own connections or based on recommendations from others.
“When I was trying to do it at the beginning, I just started emailing people, whoever had a public email address that I thought could be involved. I just emailed them and said, ‘I’m a writer in the area, I want to start this reading series, do you want to help?’” Corbin said. “Everyone was super eager to help; it’s a great community around here.” 
The three authors at the Trident event were Elaine Isaak, author of “Elisha Barber,” Lyra Selene, author of “Amber & Dusk” and N.S. Dolkart, author of “Silent Hall.” The authors read short excerpts from their respective novels. The night concluded with a Q&A segment with questions from both the host and audience members. 
Isaak, who often writes under the pseudonym E.C. Ambrose, read from “Elisha Barber,” which focuses on the protagonist Elisha, a surgeon and barber set in 14th-century London. She crafted the whole series after envisioning a scene of Elisha standing with his hands bloodied and in awe of his actions. She said she did not outline, but instead wrote frantically, initially producing five books around her character.
“In fiction circles, we often talk about plotters vs. pantsers,” Ambrose said. “So pantsers are people who fly by the seat of their pants. I wrote three other books that way first, so when I came up with the idea for Elisha Barber, I sort of immediately sprang into it.”
Dolkart spoke next, sporting a black t-shirt printed with the cover of “Silent Hall.” He read from his book, focusing on the reintroduction of a “dragon-person” in the series, which was received with laughter. He said his inspiration drew from his readings of the Torah. 
“That was the kind of world I wrote, where the gods might kill you or chase you or terrify you for mysterious reasons, and you might never find out why,” Dolkart said. “Humanity in my series is just trying to appease multiple gods without really any knowledge of what will work.”
He said he was not an outliner either, but created stories as he went. He said he surprised himself when he found all the loose ends in his novels came together. 
“I felt like I was a not-juggler, like someone who doesn’t know how to juggle who just chucked a bunch of stuff in the air and then magically caught it all,” Dolkart said.
Selene read from her novel “Amber & Dusk.” Her inspiration mainly drew from the Sun King, Louis XIV.
“The one thing that really fascinated me was the emphasis on modes of decorum,” Selene said. “There are really rigid rules of polite society where every hour of the day was rigidly structured as a way for Louis XIV to control his nobility.”
The Q&A portion of the night covered a range of topics including outlining techniques, what their upcoming novels would be as drinks and the idea of magic."
https://huntnewsnu.com/57453/campus/nupd-pushes-multiple-safety-initiatives-as-students-are-concerned-on-campus/,NUPD pushes multiple safety initiatives as students are concerned on campus,"Alyssa Lukpat, news correspondent","February 6, 2019","Students are concerned about safety on campus after two Northeastern students were robbed at gunpoint one block from campus last December. With options like safety escorts and apps, Northeastern students have different resources to stay protected. But are these options necessary or effective?
Fatema Janahi, a second-year computer engineering major, said they’re necessary. She said she feels unsafe walking through Ruggles at night and finds these resources useful.
“I’ve never used [the] Red Eye [shuttle] or anything, but I’ve used Northeastern escorts,” she said. “They’re helpful late at night, when it’s especially unsafe.”
When students arrive for orientation, the Northeastern University Police Department, or NUPD, briefs them on campus safety resources. These include the SafeZone app, Blue Light phones, the Red Eye shuttle and safety escorts, said NUPD Staff Sgt. John J. Farrell.
“We use orientation as a means to say, ‘Call us,’ because we are a police department,” Farrell said. “There are a tremendous amount of resources here to be safe, to stay safe and to utilize in order to reduce risk of victimization in any way, shape or form.”
While Farrell believes Northeastern is safe, he acknowledged that campuses in Boston have unique safety issues.
“The one thing that colleges and universities have around here is that they’re open campuses,” he said. “It’s very easy for someone to blend into open campuses and take advantage of liberties it provides.”
This is why Farrell wants Northeastern community members to download the SafeZone app. The free app allows users to notify NUPD in the event of an emergency.
“It’s quick and easy to get in touch with us,” he said. “If you have an emergency, you bring up the app and press a button, and you’re telling us by pressing that button that you have a very important situation and you need help and you need it fast.”
Janahi downloaded SafeZone, but she isn’t sure how effective it is.
“It’s not as helpful because you’re just pressing a button and you feel like, ‘What are you [going to] do?’” she said. “You’ll be dead by the time [NUPD] gets there.”
Students can also use the safety app Umergency, which provides a medical consent form, local emergency numbers and national hotlines. It also lets users notify their parents in an emergency, said AJ Schenbaum, Umergency’s vice president of strategy..
“Schools spend a lot of money on campus safety,” Schenbaum said. “There’s not one thing that will solve all of these issues out there, but hopefully we’re providing something that will create a little peace of mind and a little less anxiety out there.”
Schenbaum said students in the past were less concerned about safety. Now, he said, young people are more likely to utilize safety resources.
“Reality is changing. Students are concerned about their health and welfare and they want to be prepared,” Schenbaum said.
Farrell said he hopes Blue Light phones will help the Northeastern community feel safe. Students can locate these phone boxes, which are actually red, and other campus services by visiting bit.ly/nupdmap. Farrell said NUPD wants to place more of these phones on campus and equip them with voice technology and cameras.
“Some might argue it’s an older technology, so why do we have it?” Farrell said. “We firmly believe in Blue Light technology. If you lose your phone or it’s stolen and [Blue Lights] are your only means of communication to us, we want you to have it.”"
https://huntnewsnu.com/57480/campus/program-for-legacy-students-creates-confusion-isolation/,"Program for legacy students creates confusion, isolation","Corey Dockser, multimedia manager","February 6, 2019","When Matthew Han, a first-year who plans to be a business administration major, listed his older brother as a graduate of Northeastern University on the Common Application, he had no idea it would result in his placement in a mysterious program upon admission to the school.
“I just applied to Northeastern and I got accepted through the ContiNUe program,” Han said. “When they sent me my acceptance letter, it said you’ve been accepted to the ContiNUe program, and no one understood what that meant.”
ContiNUe is a program that began this academic year for legacy students, people who have an immediate family member who has graduated from Northeastern. A total of 44 students are currently enrolled in the program, said Vice President of Communications at NU Renata Nyul in an email to The News on Feb. 5. Most of them are housed at the Midtown Hotel, and a few commute. 
ContiNUe students take classes through the College of Professional Studies, and can matriculate to an academic college after a year if they meet certain requirements.
They’re given a limited choice in the classes they can take, in some cases preventing them from working toward their intended major. As they aren’t enrolled in the respective schools for their prospective majors, they don’t yet count as being enrolled in that major. James Sibley, a first-year who plans on being a biology major, already had credits for all of the available CPS courses he needed to take for his major from AP classes in high school.
“Last semester I only took electives because the few APs I had coming in lined up with the core classes they offered,” Sibley said. “I only feel prepared because of high school. I did AP [biology] in high school but other than that, there’s no preparation for my major.”
Every student in the program is also required to take a monthly entrepreneurship seminar. The class, which is three hours long, features guest speakers and is meant to link together different majors with entrepreneurship as a theme that “cuts across disciplines,” Nyul said in the email. 
Students in the program described the class as unproductive. Hussein Mehdi, a first-year who is undecided on which major he wants to pursue, said that while he appreciated a few of the guest speakers, he found the class overall to be pointless. 
“There’s no curriculum, it’s just us sitting and they talk to us about what it means to be an entrepreneur, but there are no actual submissions,” Mehdi said. “I just don’t learn anything from it. I don’t get anything out of it.”
While students in the ContiNUe program will matriculate as regular second-year students at the end of the academic year, they’ve largely been separated from campus life, said TJ Scanlon, a first-year who plans to be an architecture major. 
“We didn’t have an orientation with everyone else. We were here, they just didn’t tell us about any of the activities,” Scanlon said. “It seems like such a simple thing to do, just send us an email with the times of things so we could go and participate. It shouldn’t have been a big deal to just tell us that there were things happening.”
Sibley said the only reason he knew about Fall Fest was that he walked into it by accident. If he wasn’t a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, he said, he wouldn’t have any contact with students on campus.
Corey DockserJames Sibley, a first-year student who plans to be a biology major, is part of the ContiNUe program.
Sibley said that part of the reason the ContiNUe students were housed together was to facilitate friendship in the small group. This hasn’t panned out, he said.
“We have a [friend] group of five or six here at the hotel, and outside of that I’d say I barely talk to anyone else,” Sibley said. “I’m acquainted with them, I know their names, but that’s about it.”
None of the students in the ContiNUe program applied to be a part of it. Rather, their participation was a condition of their enrollment to the university – they had to choose between joining ContiNUe or looking at other universities. 
A general lack of information about the program complicated the students’ decisions.. Han said he repeatedly emailed the advisor for the program for more information.
“I emailed her trying to find out what the program was about because I didn’t understand it, no one understood it, and she wouldn’t really answer my question,” Han said. “She would direct me to emails that they sent out the first couple of days, the first weeks.”
Corey DockserMatthew Han sits in his hotel room at the Midtown Hotel, where ContiNUe students are housed.
Despite their lack of choice in the matter, the confusing nature of the program and the frustrations of living far away from campus, many ContiNUe students were still glad to be accepted to the university.
“I’m very thankful for this program because I wanted to go to this school,” Mehdi said. “If it weren’t for this program I wouldn’t be at Northeastern.”
Luca Curatola, a first-year who is undecided on which major he wants to pursue, said he wasn’t too bothered by the program, despite its flaws.
“I don’t look at it really differently from any other freshman year,” Hieratola said. “We’re not as integrated into the school as other freshman but it’s the same education and we’re transitioned into the school normally anyways, so I think it’s worth it.”
The university plans to continue the program next year, Nyul said in the email, though it hasn’t yet decided where students will be housed. The Midtown Hotel is currently being acquired by real estate company National Development, which hasn’t yet decided what it will do with the property or when it may cease operations as a hotel. 
If the program returns next year, current students say it will need a clearer purpose and better messaging, and ideally wouldn’t involve separating students from the rest of the university.
“I feel like the program isn’t fully finished and they shouldn’t have had it because no one understands what it is,” Han said. “It’s like they’re flying an airplane while building it.”"
