# scrapes
This is where we will host our python code and whatnot


THIS FILE CONTAINS MOST OF THE INTERESTING FUNCTIONS SO FAR
scraping.py
= our initial scraping fns,

FUNCTIONS HAVING TO DO WITH WRITING TO AND FROM CSVs
generator.py
= fns that write stuff in a certain format to a csv in 'Generated' folder (will implement with scraping fns in driver)

DRIVER
driver.py
= the driver (ie main)

generated (folder)
= the folder where we will store our generated csv's


THE REST ARE STUBS RN
visualization.py
= the analysis and visualization fns

test_generator.py
= tests for generator fns (if that's feasible)

test_scraping.py
= the various tests we will have of our scraping fns

test_visualization.py
= the tests for the visualization fns
