# scrapes
This is where we will host our python code and whatnot



generated (folder)

generator.py
= fns that write stuff in a certain format to a csv in 'Generated' folder (will implement with scraping fns in driver)

scraping.py
= our initial scraping fns,

visualization.py
= the analysis and visualization fns



driver.py
= the driver (ie main)



test_generator.py
= tests for generator fns (if that's feasible)

test_scraping.py
= the various tests we will have of our scraping fns
